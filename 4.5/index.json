    "summary": "Image Consolidation Migration Plan Overview This document outlines the safe migration strategy to consolidate all documentation images into a single /docs/docs/images/ directory while avoiding naming conflicts and preserving all references. Current State Total Images: 2,072 files across 26 directories Duplicate Filenames: 112 files with naming conflicts Total References: 2,450 image references in markdown files Total Size: ~1.5 GB of images Migration Strategy 1. Duplicate Resolution For files with duplicate names, we'll use directory-based prefixes: alert-form.png from /blocks-toolbox/recommendations/images/ → blocks-toolbox-recommendations-alert-form.png alert-form.png from /concepts/recommendation/images/ → concepts-recommendation-alert-form.png alert-form.png from /docs/images/ → docs-alert-form.png 2. Reference Updates All markdown files will be updated to use the new consolidated paths: Current: images/alert-form.png (relative to current directory) New: ../../images/blocks-toolbox-recommendations-alert-form.png (relative to consolidated directory) 3. Execution Steps Step 1: Analyze Current State (COMPLETED ✓) python3 scripts/analyze-images.py Generated image-migration-data.json with complete inventory Identified all duplicates and references Step 2: Dry Run python3 scripts/migrate-images-safely.py --dry-run Preview all changes without making modifications Verify duplicate resolution strategy Step 3: Execute Migration python3 scripts/migrate-images-safely.py Creates timestamped backup Updates all markdown references Moves images to consolidated directory Verifies all references work Cleans up old image locations Step 4: Verify Build docfx build --serve Ensure DocFX builds without warnings Test sample pages for broken images Step 5: Commit Changes git add -A git commit -m \"feat: Consolidate all images into single directory with duplicate resolution\" Benefits Simplified Structure: Single location for all images No Overwrites: All duplicates safely renamed Preserved History: Git tracks all moves Easy Maintenance: Future images go to one place Better Performance: Simplified asset loading Rollback Plan If issues arise: Backup is created with timestamp Git revert to previous commit Restore from backup if needed Next Steps After Migration Update documentation guidelines for image placement Add CI check to enforce single image directory Consider image optimization for large files Document new image naming conventions"

Auto Approval Company Administrators in the Subscription Manager can set up Auto Approval for any users who sign up using the Company name.

To enable Auto Approval, first log in to XMPro Subscription Manager as a Company Administrator. Then: Click Users in the left menu to open the Users page. Open the Access Requests page by clicking the Registration Requests button in the command bar. Open the Auto Approve page by clicking the Setup Auto Approve button in the command bar. Check the Enable auto approve checkbox. Choose a Default Role that will be given to new users. Click Save. Default Subscriptions Company Administrators in the Subscription Manager have the ability to determine if users signing up to the Subscription Manager are given access to products by default. They can also assign users a default specific role, according to what they have configured. For example, if a Company Administrator set the Data Stream Designer to be a default product and set the default role for this product to \"General User\", any new person signing up will be given access to the Data Stream Designer as a general user when the Company Administrator approves their request for access to Subscription Manager. Thus, there is no need to have every user signing up request a subscription to every product they need access to, on top of Subscription Manager, and approve every request individually. To set this up, follow the steps below: Click on Subscriptions from the left-hand menu. Select the product you would like to be a default product. Select the \"Is default?\" check box. Select the role that the new users should hold on this product after they have been automatically been given access from the \"Default Role\" drop-down. Click Save."

    "summary": "Actions Blocks Actions blocks in XMPro App Designer enable user interactions and trigger functionality within your applications. These blocks allow users to navigate between pages, submit forms, execute operations, and interact with data sources. Available Actions Blocks Box Hyperlink - A container that acts as a clickable hyperlink Button - A standard button control for triggering actions Data Operations - A block for performing operations on data sources Hyperlink - A text-based hyperlink for navigation Best Practices for Using Actions Blocks Use clear and descriptive labels: Ensure that action labels clearly communicate what will happen when the user interacts with them. For example, use \"Save\" instead of \"OK\" for a button that saves a form. Provide visual feedback: Use visual cues to indicate when an action is being processed or has been completed. This helps users understand the status of their interactions. Consider placement and visibility: Position action blocks where users expect to find them and ensure they are easily visible. Follow standard UI patterns, such as placing primary actions on the right and secondary actions on the left. Implement appropriate validation: Before executing actions that modify data or navigate away from a page, ensure that appropriate validation is performed to prevent data loss or invalid operations. Handle errors gracefully: When actions encounter errors, provide clear and helpful error messages that guide users on how to resolve the issue. Optimize for performance: Actions should be responsive and execute quickly. If an action requires significant processing time, provide feedback to the user and consider using asynchronous processing. Consider accessibility: Ensure that action blocks are accessible to all users, including those using screen readers or keyboard navigation. Use appropriate ARIA attributes and ensure keyboard focus is managed correctly.

    "summary": "Metablock Metablock allows pro-code designers to leverage libraries to add their dynamic blocks in XMPro using script files. We recommend leveraging generative AI to write the scripts. This approach can significantly streamline the development process and enhance the functionality of the blocks. Note Only the Presentation File (HTML) is required. Utilize the other properties based on your specific needs for the Metablock behavior. Metablock Properties Behavior Presentation File (HTML) Upload the HTML script file that will be rendered in your Metablock, which is used to create dynamic blocks that may display data from a Data Source or from Value Mapping. <div class=\"foo\">bar</div> Alternatively, you can write your scripts in a single HTML file that includes both CSS and JavaScript. This approach is ideal for smaller applications. <!-- Style with CSS the div element with class foo the color blue --> <style> .foo { color: blue } </style> <!-- Html to show the text \"foo\" --> <div class=\"foo\">foo</div> <!-- JavaScript to change the text \"foo\" to \"bar\" when the page has loaded --> <script> document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() { const fooDiv = document.querySelector('.foo'); fooDiv.innerHTML = 'bar'; }); </script> Styling File (CSS) If you wish to add styling, upload a CSS file to style your Metablock control. .foo { color : green; } Script File (JavaScript) If you wish to run JavaScript, upload a JavaScript file for your Metablock. Place any initial/startup values as constants in this file. const foo = 'foo'; Data Source Common Properties Common properties include: filter, sort, show # of results, and skip # of results; See the Common Properties article for more details on common Data Source properties. To use the Data Source property, include these predefined JavaScript functions in your Script File: // Access data source when the metablcok is loaded (optional) function onDataLoaded(data){ //Access a value from the data source const foo = data.find(obj => 'foo' in obj).foo; } // Access live updates on the data source after the metablock has been loaded (optional) function onDataChanged(data, changes){ } onDataLoaded(data) sample data format [ { \"ReadingNo\": 911, \"Timestamp\": \"2024-08-16T07:24:00.1791525Z\", \"value\": 3.6695501388374483, \"entityid\": \"static\", \"_$parentProperties\": {}, \"_$parentExpressions\": [], \"_$state\": { \"_$typeName\": \"EntityState\", \"name\": \"Unchanged\" } } ] The data above originates from a data stream that we've set up and it runs once upon page load. Keep in mind that the data format might differ based on your data source configuration. onDataChanged(data, changes) sample data format //data from `data` variable [ { \"ReadingNo\": 1156, \"Timestamp\": \"2024-08-16T08:04:52.3154712Z\", \"value\": 1.5450710600917559, \"entityid\": \"static\", \"_$parentProperties\": {}, \"_$parentExpressions\": [], \"_$state\": { \"_$typeName\": \"EntityState\", \"name\": \"Unchanged\" } } ] //data from `changes` variable [ { \"ReadingNo\": 1156, \"Timestamp\": \"2024-08-16T08:04:52.3154712Z\", \"value\": 1.5450710600917559, \"entityid\": \"static\", \"_$parentProperties\": {}, \"_$parentExpressions\": [], \"_$state\": { \"_$typeName\": \"EntityState\", \"name\": \"Unchanged\" } } ] In this example, both the data and changes variables contain identical data, indicating that there are no updates. However, in a real-world scenario, the changes variable would capture any modifications to the initial data. You can refer to a working example script that demonstrates an Autodesk Forge visualization here. Value Value Mapping If you wish to define value mappings for run-time use, you can configure user-defined key-value pairs. These values remain static during application rendering. The Value Mapping opens a new blade to setup the Key and Value configuration. The options for the Value Source are Static, Dynamic, Expression and Variables. When selecting Server Variables as a Source for the Value Mapping, the list of unencrypted Server Variables will be displayed. Tick the Encrypt checkbox to use an encrypted Server Variable for values like keys, secrets, or password. From v4.4.18, encrypted Server Variables will not have their value available immediately on the Metablock. Instead, you can use them inside a Fetch/XHR request or a Websocket/MQTT message before being forwarded to the actual target. Fetch/XHR Request - You can use encrypted server variables as part of the URL, Header, or Body of the Fetch/XHR request. Websocket/MQTT Message - You can use encrypted server variables as part of the Websocket message. For MQTT Messages, you can use it as part of the following message types: Connect (Username and Password), Publish (Payload), and Subscribe (Subscribe Topics) Proxy Requests Tick to proxy requests on the AD Server before being forwarded to the actual request. This is ticked by default when using an encrypted server variable on the value mapping, but you can opt in to use it even without any encrypted server variable. To use Value Mapping, include this predefined JavaScript function in your Script File: // Access Value mapping data when the metablock is loaded (optional) function onValueMappingLoaded(data){ //Apply a value from the value mapping const foo = data['foo']; } OnValueMappingLoaded(data) sample data format { \"key\": \"Value\", \"isWorking\": true, \"counter\": 10 \"password\": \"{{var-x:Encrypted Variable Name}}\" //Encrypted Server Variable template } Warning Note: The password property will not have the actual value yet when it is mapped from an Encrypted Server Variable. Instead, it is just a template for the Server Variable name.

View on GitHub Autodesk: visualize 2D & 3D models Access and visualize your engineering data and designs from the cloud using Autodesk Platform Services (APS, formerly Forge). Leverage Value Mapping when embedding the APS Viewer in XMPro App Pages to display interactive 2D and 3D views of your designs. Note: This is a simple example to demonstrate the APS Viewer API using an unauthenticated repository. Refer to the authenticated use case for a more complex example that includes security measures for credentials.

For simplicity, the HTML, CSS & JavaScript has been combined into a single file. <!-- main.html --> <h1>Autodesk Forge Viewer</h1> <div id=\"main\"></div> /* main.css */ h1 { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color : #333; } // main.js var hasInitialized = false; function onValueMappingLoaded(data) { // Prevent multiple initializations if (hasInitialized) return; hasInitialized = true; // Load the CSS forge dependencies const cssViewerUrl = 'https://developer.api.autodesk.com/modelderivative/v2/viewers/style.min.css?v=v7.*'; loadCSSViewer(cssViewerUrl); // Load the forge viewer var viwerUrl = 'https://developer.api.autodesk.com/modelderivative/v2/viewers/7.*/viewer3D.min.js'; var viewer = loadViewer(viwerUrl); // Get the model URL from the data const modelUrl = data['model_url'] // Load the model into the viewer loadModel(viewer, modelUrl); } function loadViewer(viewer_url) { return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { const script = document.createElement('script'); script.src = viewer_url; script.onload = resolve; script.onerror = reject; document.head.appendChild(script); }); } function loadCSSViewer(css_viewer_url){ return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { const link = document.createElement('link'); link.rel = \"stylesheet\"; link.type = \"text/css\"; link.href = css_viewer_url; link.onload = resolve; link.onerror = reject; document.head.appendChild(link); }); } // Loads the model into the viewer function loadModel(viewer, modelUrl) { viewer.then(() => { var myViewerDiv = document.getElementById('main'); var viewer = new Autodesk.Viewing.Private.GuiViewer3D(myViewerDiv); var options = { 'env': 'Local', 'document': modelUrl }; Autodesk.Viewing.Initializer(options, function onInitialized() { viewer.start(options.document, options); }); }).catch((error) => { console.error('Failed to load Forge viewer:', error); }); } Step 3: Testing your code locally (Optional) Test it locally before implementation by running it from another html file (test-harness.html) via a local webserver. A 3D interactive model of a house should load in your browser. Create the test-harness.html file in the same directory as your Metablock files. !-- test-harness.html --> <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> <meta charset=\"UTF-8\"> <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"> <title>Test Harness for XMPro Metablocks</title> <!-- Favicon --> <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/x-icon\" href=\"/favicon.ico\"> <!-- Link to the Metablock CSS file --> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"main.css\"> </head> <body> <!-- Container for the Metablock HTML content --> <div id=\"main\"> <p id=\"loading\">Loading content...</p> </div> <!-- Include the Metablock JavaScript file --> <script src=\"main.js\"></script> <script> // Fetch the content of main.html and inject it into the #main div fetch('main.html') .then(response => response.text()) .then(html => { // Insert the fetched HTML into the #main div document.getElementById('main').innerHTML = html; // Initialize static data for the Metablock // This object allows passing specific initialization data to the JavaScript // through the onValueMappingLoaded function var data = { // model_url: The url of the model to be displayed in the Metablock // This would be passed in from the XMPro Metablock configuration Value Mapping. model_url: \"https://developer-autodesk.github.io/translated-models/dwfx-sample-house/f0224dd3-8767-45c1-ff99-5c9c881b9fee/0.svf\" // Add any other required initialization parameters here, for example: // api_endpoint: \"https://api.example.com/v1\", // debug_mode: true, // theme: \"dark\" } // Call the onValueMappingLoaded function with the initialization data // This function should be defined in main.js and will use the provided data // to set up the Metablock's initial state onValueMappingLoaded(data); }) .catch(error => { // Log any errors that occur during the fetch operation console.error('Error loading main.html:', error); }); </script> </body> </html> Run the test-harness.html in a webserver (node.js) Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it from https://nodejs.org/. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project folder where the metablock files are. Initialize a new Node.js project by running npm init -y Install Express by running npm install express Create public folder and moved your HTML, CSS & JavaScript files inside Create a file named server.js copy and paste below code in server.js file // server.js const express = require('express'); const path = require('path'); const app = express(); const port = process.env.PORT || 3000; // Serve static files from the 'public' directory app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname , 'public'))); app.get('/', (req, res) => { res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'test-harness.html')); }); app.use((req,res) => { res.status(404); res.send(`<h1>Error 404: Resource not found</h1>`); }); // Start the server app.listen(port, () => { console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`); }); To start the server, run node server.js Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 Step 4: Configure the Metablock in App Designer Drag the Metablock onto your page. Open Block Properties. Add the 3 Metablock files by clicking on the plus icon and uploading the main.html, main.css, main.js files and selecting each from their respective dropdown. Add a Value Mapping of key model_url and Value https://developer-autodesk.github.io/translated-models/dwfx-sample-house/f0224dd3-8767-45c1-ff99-5c9c881b9fee/0.svf Save the page Launch the page Example Files Refer to the simple Autodesk use case for a complete set of files for this example. Security Features We have added security features in Metablock to safeguard the users from potential attacks, When developing applications, we have selectively enabled the following features: Form Submission Pop-up windows Modal Dialogs JavaScript Features External Resources Allowed Downloads (v4.4.18) Additionally, Metablock allows the use of specific hardware APIs for enhanced application capabilities, including camera, encrypted-media, full-screen, geo-location, speaker, accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and midi. FAQs Why did the JavaScript code in my Metablock not execute on page load? Due to the timing of function instantiation, we recommend checking the document's ready state instead of relying on the load event: Check document's ready state: if (document.readyState === 'complete') { // add your logic here } Alternatively use one of the existing functions. function onValueMappingLoaded(data) { // add your logic here } How can I load multiple script files? From v4.4.18, you can load external script files by including a script block - the same as you would usually do in a html file. The same applies to style/CSS files. <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js\"></script> You can also reference resources (js, css, image) uploaded on your App Files folder by following the correct format for the URL when referencing. Prefix the path with \"./AppFiles/\" and append the path of the App Files resource: \"./AppFiles/{path on the App Files}\" See the following example for the html that links different resources from the App File: App Files For an App Files folder structure that looks like this: offline_files/ ├── offline_image.png ├── offline-script.js └── offline-styles.css HTML Link the resources by following the correct format. ex. \"./AppFiles/offline_files/offline-script.js\" <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> <meta charset=\"UTF-8\"> <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"> <title>My Web Page</title> <!-- Loading style resource from AppFiles --> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"./AppFiles/offline_files/offline-styles.css\"> </head> <body> <!-- Loading image resource from AppFiles --> <img id=\"image\" src=\"./AppFiles/offline_files/offline-image.png\" alt=\"Offline Image\"> <div class=\"container\"> <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1> <p>This is a sample page that uses <span class=\"highlight\">AppFiles</span> resources for js, css and images.</p> <button id=\"clickMe\">Click Me!</button> <p id=\"counter\">Button clicks: 0</p> </div> <!-- Loading script resource from AppFiles --> <script src=\"./AppFiles/offline_files/offline-script.js\"></script> <!-- Loading script resource from an external link --> <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js\"></script> <script> $(document).ready(function() { let flipped = false; $('#image').click(function() { flipped = !flipped; $(this).css('transform', flipped ? 'scaleX(-1)' : 'scaleX(1)'); }); }); </script> </body> </html> Note GitHub Repository: Link App Files Resources Example View the complete implementation example for linking App Files resources. View on GitHub Warning Note: Displaying the Metablock may take some time since it needs to finish loading all referenced App File resources before it is shown on the Application. Avoid referencing heavy files from the App Files and use external resources instead. You can also dynamically load JavaScript files but only for external resources and not from the App Files. function loadScript(url) { return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { const script = document.createElement('script'); script.src = url; script.onload = resolve; script.onerror = reject; document.head.appendChild(script); }); } Why is the Metablock throwing 500 errors related to styling and script files? This can occur if your HTML file includes inline script import code that does not follow the correct format. Only link external resources or make sure the file is uploaded on App Files and the URL format is correct. <!-- unsupported import script --> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"> <!-- unsupported import script --> <script src=\"app.js\"></script> <!-- valid html --> <span>foo</span>"

Note Some images in this document may be missing and need to be migrated from the original GitBook documentation. Important Strike a balance between style and performance. Keep in mind that the larger the file size and the more images added to a single App Page, the longer the loading time. This effect will be felt during both design (open and save of an App) and run time. When in doubt, use fewer images and aim for a file size of 200kb or less.

Image Source Choose whether the image is stored in App Files (default) or Embedded. The App Files option, added in v4.4.17, is the recommended image source - embedded files bloat the app size and cannot be copied/downloaded/reused. Image You can select the Image you want to be displayed. The following image file types are supported: BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, SVG, and WEBP. Behavior The Image block doesn't have specific behavior properties beyond the common ones.

In v4.4.17, a new \"Image Source\" property was added to the Image Block, allowing images to be stored in App Files. This enhancement allows images to be shared across multiple blocks and improves storage and retrieval efficiency. Previously, images could only be embedded within individual blocks."

Tip When searching a Tree Grid, the search results include their parents: If your result includes a parent, the children will not be available to expand unless they also meet the search criteria. If your result includes a child, the parents are listed for navigation - even if they don't meet the search criteria. Allow Adding When it's enabled, there are two places where the user can add a new record: an Add button appears at the top of the Tree Grid and in the right-most column. The Add button in the top-right corner adds a new record at the root level of the Tree Grid. The Add option in the right-most column adds a new child record. For example, if you select 'Add' under 'Arthur', a new record is added as a child of the 'Arthur' record. Edit Mode The user can edit the data in several modes. The option is only available when Allow Updating is enabled. Mode Description Batch A user edits data in cells across multiple rows - indicated by a green border. Changes are not applied until the user clicks the Save button. Click Reset to revert the changes. Batch With External Save As with Batch mode, the user edits data in cells across multiple rows - indicated by a green border. However, the user must add a separate block (such as a Button) to apply the changes. Manually configure this button's Update Data Sources section in Block Properties: select a Data Source (such as the Tree Grid's Data Source), and the action(s) to be taken (update, refresh, or delete). Cell A user edits the data cell by cell. Changes are saved once a cell loses focus, or discarded if a user presses Esc. Row The user edits data row by row. When a user clicks the Edit button in the right-most column, the corresponding row becomes editable and Save and Cancel buttons appear in the right-most column. Click the Save button to apply the changes. Allow Drag & Drop When it's enabled, it will show the drag icon by default in front of the row. The user can change the location of the row by clicking the icon and dragging the row. A row can be dragged inside another row to nest it underneath. If this is disabled, reordering is not available. The Drag and Drop option is only available when the Edit mode is set to either 'Row' or 'Cell'. Show Drag Icons When it's enabled, it will show the drag icon in front of the row. The user can reorder the row by clicking the icon and dragging the row. If this is disabled, the user can click anywhere on the row and drag the row. Maximum Tree Depth The limit for the Maximum Tree Depth determines how many levels of nested records the user will be allowed to expand and view. For example, if there is no Maximum Tree Depth limit set, the user will be able to expand and view all nested records. If the Maximum Tree Depth limit is set to 2, the user can only expand records until the second level, and they will no longer be able to expand any further. The Maximum Tree Depth limit also applies to adding and updating rows. The option to add a new row is only available for records within the Max Tree Depth limit specified. Store User Selection When enabled, your selected row is saved at runtime in your browser's local storage, so that you return to the same row when the page reloads without having to re-navigate the tree. This includes re-opening the App and returning from a drill-down. Value Common Properties The value property is common to most Blocks. See the Common Properties article for more details on common value properties. If the value is set to the ID of a record in a Data Source, that record will be selected when the application is launched. Data Source Common Properties Properties that are common to most Blocks include data source, filter, sort, show # of results, and skip # of results. See the Common Properties article for more details on common Data Source properties. The Data Source property is required for the Tree Grid. Data Parent Id The Parent Id tells the component how the fields are connected to each other. The Parent Id refers to the Id of the parent record. For example, in the hierarchy of employees, multiple people could report to one manager, so their parent Ids would be the Id of the person they are listed underneath. If the parent Id of a record is set to null or 0, it will automatically be placed as a root or main parent element on the tree. The Parent Id property is required for the Tree Grid. Columns Common Properties See the Data Grid article for details on common column properties: Format, Currency, Date Time Format, Editor Type - Lookup, Editor Type - Hyperlink, and Editor Type - Indicator, and Open in New Tab/Window. Order The order allows you to specify the format for the columns. This includes the visibility of the columns, the alignment, the captions, or the width. Action Common Properties Properties that are common to most Blocks include: Navigate To and Show Confirmation Dialog; See the Common Properties article for more details on common action properties."

    "summary": "Common Properties Appearance This determines how the control looks. For example, this may include colors, text, or the visibility of certain aspects of the control. Visible This determines if the Block can be seen or if it is hidden. Styling Mode This specifies the style of the control, including if it is underlined, highlighted, or outlined. Placeholder This will show a temporary hint or description inside the field to help the user know what information is required. It disappears when the user enters a value. Tooltip This displays extra information about the field when the user hovers their mouse over it. Show Clear Button This determines if a clear button shows next to the value that the user entered. The clear button will clear the entered value if it is clicked. Icon The mode of the icon refers to the different ways the icon can be uploaded or added onto the control. This includes adding a pre-built icon from the library, uploading your own icon, or using the URL of an icon that exists on the web. Format The format refers to the type or way that data is presented. Options for these include currency, decimal, exponential, fixed point, large number, percent, thousands, millions, billions, trillions, milliseconds, seconds, minutes, or hours. Behavior This describes the behavior of a control. For example, read-only or disabled prevents the user from modifying the control. Read Only Disabled Value The value is the value that is taken from the control such as the user input, or the default value of the control that you predefine. Data Source Data Sources can be created for a page in the application and can be used to display contextual or real-time data to the user. Data sources can include databases or data streams and can be bound to controls on the page. Note It is recommended that you read the article listed below to improve your understanding of Data Sources. How to Create and Manage Data Sources Filter This allows you to filter the records to only display certain results that meet a condition. For example, displaying all records last modified in 2021. Sort This allows you to sort records in increasing or decreasing order. Show # of Results Shows a limited number of results. Skip # of Results This will skip a number of records in the list. Show Default Row This will determine if the default row is always shown, only shown when empty, or never shown. Validation Validation involves making sure the user enters the correct information on controls such as a form. Fields or Fieldsets (a group of fields) can be added to the page with a corresponding confirm button for the form. If the button and fields are configured to have validation and the user clicks on the confirm button, the fields in the form will be validated. Field Validation Group The validation group is able to group multiple forms on a page, each with its own action button. For example, if the user clicks on the confirm button for validation group 1, only the fields under that validation group will be validated. Required If the field is blank, the form will not be submitted and an error will show. Pattern If the user enters a value that does not match a specific pattern (for example, the input must contain at least two words), the form will not be submitted and an error will show. Validation patterns use Regular Expressions (regex) to pattern search the value and determine validity. Note For more information on Regular Expressions, see the JavaScript RegExp Reference article on w3schools. Message This is the text that displays to the user when the user did not enter the value correctly. Action Groups to Validate This is an option for buttons that allows you to choose the validation group the button should validate. Action The action refers to any event that may be triggered when the user clicks on a Block or part of a Block. For example, the page may redirect to another page or website, a data source may be updated, or a confirmation dialog may appear. Navigate To This configures the page or website that the webpage will navigate to when the user clicks on a control. The options are: Landing Page takes you to the current App's landing page Page takes you to the specified page of the current App, optionally in a new tab/window Previous Page takes you to the previous page of the browser URL takes you to the specified URL (any website), optionally in a new tab/window Page The page to which the user is redirected, which is applicable when Navigate To is set to 'Page'. See the Navigate Between Pages article for more information about navigating between pages. URL The URL to which the user is redirected, which is applicable when Navigate To is set to 'URL'. Note You can use a mailto link with the URL navigation to open a default mail program (for example, Microsoft Outlook) with an email address already added into the receiver field. See the Navigating Using Back URL article for more information about appending a back URL so that the user can return to the page. Open in New Tab/Window Tick for the URL to open in a new tab/window, instead of redirecting the current tab. This applies when Navigate To is set to 'Page' or 'URL'. Pass Page Parameters You can use parameters if you want to send particular values to another page. For example, you may want to send the value of a control to another page as the user is navigating to it, in order to change the data on that page dynamically. See the Pass Parameters between Pages article for more information about how to pass parameters between pages. Update Page Data You can configure what and how the data should be updated on the current page. See the Page Data article for more information. Update Data Sources Operations include inserting records, updating, deleting, or refreshing a data source. For example, if the user clicks on a button, the details they entered can then be inserted as a record in the database. If multiple operations are required, the order that these actions are executed can be changed. For example, you may want to update the database first before deleting a record. If the execution condition option is set to true, you will then be able to add a condition that will be checked before operations are executed. You also have the option to override the fields that are in the data source. Note If you're enabling an operation on a Block that does not populate or visualize from a Data Source, such as a Button, first bind a Data Source to either the Block or its parent. Confirmation Dialog If the confirmation dialog option is enabled, a confirmation message dialog box will appear when the user clicks on the button. The title and message of the dialog box can be configured as well as the text on the continue and cancel buttons."

    "summary": "Device Input Blocks Device Input blocks allow users to interact with your XMPro applications using various device capabilities, such as cameras and location services. These blocks enable the capture of real-world data directly through the user's device. Available Device Input Blocks Location Capture - Captures the user's geographical location using the device's GPS or network-based location services Visual Media Capture - Captures photos or videos using the device's camera Best Practices for Using Device Input Blocks Request permissions appropriately: Device input blocks often require specific permissions from the user (e.g., camera access, location access). Ensure that your application requests these permissions at the appropriate time and provides clear explanations of why they are needed. Handle permission denials gracefully: Users may deny permission for your application to access certain device features. Your application should handle these situations gracefully and provide alternative ways for users to accomplish their tasks. Consider device capabilities: Not all devices have the same capabilities. Some may have multiple cameras, while others may have limited or no location services. Design your application to adapt to the available device capabilities. Optimize for performance: Capturing and processing device input can be resource-intensive. Optimize your application to minimize battery drain and ensure smooth performance. Provide feedback: Give users clear feedback when device input is being captured or processed. This helps users understand what's happening and can improve the overall user experience. Respect privacy: Be transparent about how device input data is used and stored. Only capture the data you need, and ensure that sensitive data is handled securely. Test on multiple devices: Test your application on a variety of devices to ensure that device input blocks work correctly across different hardware and software configurations.

    "summary": "Tabs Tabs are Blocks that allow you to separate and view related items together. Tabs can be added or removed to the tab Block if needed. They are useful for creating sections that the user can switch between or grouping related groups into one area of the page. Adding a Tab To add a new Tab, select the whole tab Block or an individual Tab and click on the plus symbol in the top-right hand Block toolbar. Note See the Canvas article for more details on these controls. Deleting a Tab To delete a Tab, select the whole Tab Block or an individual Tab and click on the bin symbol in the top-right hand Block toolbar. Note See the Canvas article for more details on these controls. Navigating Between Tabs You can navigate between the Tabs within the canvas itself. Click on each Tab to open the contents within that particular Tab. Reordering Tabs Tabs can be reordered by clicking and dragging them to change the order. When a Tab is highlighted, hold the move icon and drag the Tab to another location within the Block. Note See the Canvas article for more details on these controls. Tab Properties Appearance Common Properties Tabs have properties that are common to most Blocks: visibility and tooltip. See the Common Properties article for more details on common appearance properties. Selected Index The selected index determines which tab is open by default. The index starts from 0, which means that an index of 0 refers to the first Tab, an index of 1 refers to the second Tab, and so on. Behavior Common Properties The disabled property is common to most Blocks; See the Common Properties article for more details on common behavior properties. Hide Tab Navigation When enabled, a hidden icon appears to the left of the tab icon and name on the Canvas. The user will see the selected tab's content at runtime, but they cannot see the tabs or click on another tab. The navigation between tabs is controlled by the Selected Index property, e.g. by an expression. Note This is useful when a header or footer section is reused across multiple pages. For example, one page is used in three different drill-down scenarios. The top one-third differs based on the drill-down type and the bottom two-thirds is the same for all scenarios. Rather than cloning the page and maintaining all three, place the top one-third in a Tab Block - and set the Selected Index to a parameter passed from the previous page to control which tab's content is shown. Data Source Common Properties Tabs have properties that are common to most Blocks: filter, sort, show # of results, and skip # of results; See the Common Properties article for more details on common Data Source properties. Tab Item Properties Appearance Title and Icon Each Tab has a heading that labels that particular tab section. An icon can also be added for visual purposes."

    "href": "docs/blocks-toolbox/visualizations/image-map.html",
    "title": "Image Map | XMPro",
    "summary": "Image Map The Image Map Block allows you to render dynamic and static content onto an Image. You can drag on content such as indicators or text and these render on top of the image at runtime, at the specified coordinates. The Image Map Block accepts an image, and this aspect ratio is maintained when the Block is resized on the canvas; at run-time when the window is resized; or the App is launched on differently sized displays, such as a tablet or a large control room monitor. Static and/or dynamic data can be added and their aspect ratio is also maintained so that they autoscale with the image. The static content is a container used to lock the position of other Blocks, for example, to show general information on the corners of a plant diagram. For the best results, specify the position as a percentage and the text size as vh/vw. Note vw and vh are length units representing 1% of the viewport size for viewport width (vw) and height (vh), respectively. They are ideal for specifying size - especially text - in a responsive design because they are independent of the base font size. A dynamic template is a container of other Blocks, linked to a data source. An instance of the template will show at run-time for each data point returned by the data source, positioned at the data point's specified X and Y coordinates. Multiple dynamic templates can be added if data points have different behavior and/or different data sources/filters. For example, you may have a different color indicator and a different drill-down action per asset type, such as conveyors, borers, and crushers. Besides autoscaling, the second feature of the Image Map Block is a tooltip located top left of the image to tell you the exact X/Y coordinates of any point on the image at design time. Move your mouse across the image on the canvas to decide the exact placement of data points or static content. Image Map Properties Appearance Common Properties The visibility property is common to most Blocks; See the Common Properties article for more details on common appearance properties. Image Source Choose whether the image is stored in App Files (default) or Embedded. The App Files option, added in v4.4.17, is the recommended image source - embedded files bloat the app size and cannot be copied/downloaded/reused. Image Select the background Image. Tooltip A tooltip in the top left corner of the image shows the coordinates of the mouse location when hovering over the canvas. You can use this at design time to determine the X/Y position to render your static and dynamic content. Dynamic Templates Dynamic Templates are layers on the Image Map Block that act as containers for additional Blocks like Text, Indicator, etc. These Blocks can be bound to values that come from the Dynamic Template's Data Source. A Text Block is added by default to get you started - it can be amended or replaced. One Dynamic Template is added by default and cannot be removed. No instances will show during run-time unless its Data Source, X Value, and Y Value are configured. Data Source Common Properties The Data Source property is common to most Blocks; ‌See the Common Properties article for more details on common Data Source properties. Data X Value The X Value determines the horizontal position of the Dynamic Template's run-time instances. Acceptable values are percentages, i.e. between 0 and 100. Y Value The Y Value determines the vertical position of the Dynamic Template's run-time instances. Acceptable values are percentages, i.e. between 0 and 100. Note The X and Y Values determine the run-time position of each instance of the dynamic template. You can adjust the template's position on the canvas under block styling. Positioning Although the runtime position is determined by the X and Y values, you can amend the canvas position by changing the top and left percentages in the Block Styling menu's Advanced position and displayed styling accordion. You can also change the Width and Height to a percentage or vw/vh in the Dimension accordion, and font size to vw/vh in the Typography accordion to ensure that the text is responsive. Adding a Dynamic Template To add another Dynamic Template, select any Dynamic Template and click on the plus button in the top right Block toolbar. Removing a Dynamic Template To remove a Dynamic Template, select the Dynamic Template and click on the delete button in the top right Block toolbar. Note The default Dynamic Template cannot be removed. Static Content Static Content is a layer on the Image Map Block that acts as a container to lock the position of additional Blocks like Text, Indicator, etc. A Text Block is added by default to get you started. It can be amended or replaced. Positioning Unlike Dynamic Templates, the canvas and the runtime position are the same for Static Content. You can manually position it anywhere on the image by changing the top and left percentages in the Block Styling menu's Advanced position and displayed stylingaccordion. You can also change the Width and Height to a percentage or vw/vh in the Dimension accordion, and font size to vw/vh in the Typography accordion to ensure that the text is responsive. Adding Static Content To add Static Content, select the Image Map Block and click on the plus button in the top right Block toolbar. Note If your Image layer covers the Image Map, click the up button in the top right Block toolbar. Removing Static Content To remove Static Content, select it and click on the delete button in the top right Block toolbar. Binding Data To Static Content Add a Box Block to reference a Data Source within the Static Content layer - such as Live Data from Data Streams. Once a Data Source has been configured for the Box, you can bind data on any blocks added inside via the Dynamic Properties option."

The Time Series Analysis empowers comparing data at run-time based on asset ID by dropping markers on the chart panning and zooming showing and hiding specific assets or parameters via the hierarchy panel Performance The Time Series Analysis is a specialized graphing tool that addresses the time series of asset attributes. By its nature, it will process many data points (in some cases millions); thus, extracting and processing this complex data can take time. Large data sets can place a strain on your computing resources. There is no expectation that a time series analysis will perform to the same level as bar charts in a Business Intelligence product like PowerBI. The approach to computational capability is no different than having a massive single Excel sheet or multiple sheets. We have chosen not to implement hard limits like similar products e.g. Microsoft ADX, as the data sources our customers use are wide and varied.

Link to resource Time Series Analysis Properties Appearance Common Properties The visibility property is common to most Blocks; See the Common Properties article for more details on common appearance properties. Show Legend Determines if the legend is displayed or not. X Axis Label Format Determines how the date is formatted on the x-axis of the chart and pan & zoom panel. Label Format Image 12-Hour Clock (2 Lines) 12-Hour Clock (1 Line) 24-Hour Clock (2 Lines) 24-Hour Clock (1 Line) Enable Toolbar Determines whether the toolbar is displayed or not. The toolbar contains the button to change the y-axis type and the ellipsis menu. Enable Display Grid Determines whether the ellipsis menu contains the Display Grid option, which shows the selected data in a grid. Enable Download as CSV Determines whether the ellipsis menu contains the Download as CSV option, which allows you to download the selected data as a CSV file. Pan & Zoom Mode This determines how the Pan & Zoom panel is displayed. Setting it to \"Hidden\" will remove the panel entirely, while \"Compact\" is a single-line component, and \"Full\" will display a Pan & Zoom with secondary panning and zooming for fine-tuning the selection. Pan & Zoom Mode Image Full Compact Hidden Pan & Zoom Color This determines the color of the Pan & Zoom component. Interval Size This determines the default value for the Interval Size slider. The slider allows you to fine-tune the granularity of the displayed data. The displayed line chart data will be averaged over this interval. Range - Static This determines the starting date for the Pan & Zoom. The end date of the Time Series Chart is determined by the row with the latest timestamp. The Pan & Zoom range will update automatically with live data. Note The static range is used unless Dynamic Start and Dynamic End are not zero. Range - Dynamic Start This determines the starting date for the Pan & Zoom. If changed dynamically at runtime, the Pan & Zoom range will reload to reflect the new start. The Dynamic Start date must be before the Dynamic End date. Range - Dynamic End Unlike the Static Range where the end date is determined by the row with the latest timestamp, this value specifies the end date for the Pan & Zoom. If changed dynamically at runtime, the Pan & Zoom range will reload to reflect the new end. Initial Selection This determines the time interval initially selected in the Pan & Zoom component and, correspondingly, the line chart. The selection will always start at the right side of the Pan & Zoom component. Initial Selection Unit of Time This determines which unit of time measurement is applied to the initial selection value. The options are Minutes, Days, or Hours. Upon launching the application, the initial selection and the unit of time can be observed on the interval timeline. Display Avg, Min, Max, and Envelope This determines whether the line chart will display only the average values as a plain line, or the minimum, maximum, and envelope over the selected Interval Size. Show Tooltip On Hover This determines whether a tooltip will appear when the cursor hovers over a line. The tooltip will display the values of the hovered point on the line. Enable Zoom Determines whether you can click and select on the chart to zoom into the selection. Show X Axis This determines whether the x-axis line and labels for the line chart are shown. Show Y Axis This determines whether the y-axis line and labels for the line chart are shown. Default Y Axis Type This determines the default Y Axis type, which can be changed at run-time using the button at the top-left corner of the line chart. If set to \"Stacked\" the selected parameters will be separated into different panes stacked vertically. If set to \"Shared\" the selected parameters will share a single pane with a single y-axis from the lowest to highest values in any line. If set to \"Overlap\", the selected parameters will share a single pane with multiple y-axes, with the lowest and highest value of each line chart displayed on the axis at the bottom and top. Show Dots Determines whether the points on the lines will display as dots. Interpolation Function This property allows you to define how the lines behave in the line charts. Function Line Monotone X Linear Step Step Before Step After Basis Cardinal Catmull-Rom Palette You can specify a custom color for each parameter in the line chart. If the number of parameters is greater than the number of colors specified, the colors will repeat. Behavior Recommendations The Alerts for selected Recommendations will be displayed at run-time as markers on the chart: the Alert's created time is used as the timestamp and its title as the text. Note Known limitations: The marker title space is limited and the Alert title may be truncated. Some HTML special characters (e.g.<) used in the Alert title will be encoded. Entity ID Specify an Entity ID field to filter the Recommendation Alerts. Data Source Common Properties A Data Source can be connected to a Time Series Chart. This will allow you to display data on the Time Series Chart. ‌See the Common Properties article for more details on common data source properties. The Data Source property is required for the Time Series Chart. Note Known limitations: SQL is not advised because large volumes of data may cause read issues and/or performance issues. Azure Data Explorer is the recommended time series data source. When adding a new field or expression to a Data Source already connected to a Time Series Chart, follow these steps for them to appear in the Time Series Chart configuration options: Save the Data Source. Open the Time Series Chart's Block Properties. Save the Application. Data Timestamp Expression This is the column that the data will base its x-axis on. It must be a Date Time type column. For efficient performance, it is recommended to have an index in descending order on this column in your database. The Timestamp Expression property is required for the Time Series Chart. Default Selection You can choose the line charts that the Time Series Chart will start with. If Group By Asset is disabled, you can select which parameters will be selected by default. If Group By Asset is enabled and a Hierarchy Data Source is selected, you will be able to select which Hierarchy items will be selected by default for each parameter. Hierarchy Group By Asset This determines whether the data is to be grouped by an Asset Id column on the Data Source. If not enabled, the line chart will display a single line for each parameter selected. Asset Id Expression This is the column by which data will be grouped into separate lines. Each unique value in this column will have a line. If you choose to enable Hierarchy, this is also the Foreign Key that provides a link to the Id Expression of the Hierarchy Data Source. When Group By Asset is true, the Asset Id Expression property is required for the Time Series Chart. Show Hierarchy This determines whether the Hierarchy is displayed. The hierarchy is the left panel containing a tree grid that allows you to modify the selected assets and parameters. Data Source A Hierarchy Data Source can be connected to a Time Series Chart. This will allow you to display data in the Hierarchy of the Time Series Chart. See the Common Properties article for more details on common data source properties. Id Expression The Id Expression is the identifying column for the Hierarchy. The values in this column are linked to the Asset Id Expression of the line charts, and the Parent Id Expression. If the Hierarchy Data Source is selected, the Id Expression property is required for the Time Series Chart. Name Expression The Name Expression is a user-friendly name for what the user can see. For example, the text that is showing in the List. If the Hierarchy Data Source is selected, the Name Expression property is required for the Time Series Chart. Parent Id Expression The Parent Id Expressions determine how the Hierarchy knows which rows are connected to each other as parent and child. The Parent Id refers to the Id of the parent row. If the Parent Id expression is not defined, the Hierarchy will have a flat structure. Resource Expression The Resource Expression determines whether a row is a Resource Row and can have parameters selected for it. For example, each area in a mine may have many pumps, but only the pumps are Resources and have a Motor Current, etc. If Resource Expression is not defined, only the leaf nodes in the tree will be Resources."

The Value Expression property is required for the Tree Map. Id The Id property is required for the Tree Map Parent Id The Parent Id tells the component how the fields are connected to each other. The Parent Id refers to the Id of the parent record. For example, in the hierarchy of employees, multiple people could report to one manager, so their parent Ids would be the Id of the person they are listed underneath. If the parent Id of a record is set to null or 0, it will automatically be placed as a root or main parent element on the tree. The Parent Id property is required if the Data Source is a plain data source. For hierarchical data sources, the Parent Id property is not needed.

    "href": "docs/concepts/agent/index.html",
    "title": "Agent | XMPro",
    "summary": "Agent An Agent is a reusable object which forms the building block of a Data Stream. When a number of Agents are connected together, a Data Stream is formed. Each Agent is designed to perform a specific function in the stream. For example, they can be used to retrieve data from a database in real-time, display data, filter, sort the data, or save the data somewhere else, depending on the function of that individual Agent. Agents are needed to connect to specific systems. Since Agents are individual components, new Agents can also be added and integrated into the Data Stream to complete a specific functionality. Video Presentation Discussing Agents and Collections Each Agent consists of code, settings, and other properties that are packaged into a file that can be uploaded to Data Stream Designer. XMPro has a library of Agents available to use. To acquire any of these Agents, please contact your XMPro sales representative or write to us at support@xmpro.com. Alternatively, since Agents can be written by anyone that has some knowledge of programming and has access to the required technologies, you can write your own Agent by following these instructions. Categories In Data Steam Designer, Agents are divided into different categories, depending on the overall function they perform. There are six different categories available: Action Agents, Context Providers, Listeners, Transformations, AI & Machine Learning, Recommendations, and Functions. To be able to distinguish them properly, they have been tagged with a certain color as well as an abbreviation. These categories are separate from the App and Data Stream Categories. Action Agents An Action Agent is an Agent that consumes events in a stream and then performs internal or external (third-party) actions, e.g. sending notifications or performing data warehouse updates. Action Agents output a response after each event has been processed. For example, the Azure SQL Action Agent writes data to an Azure SQL database. Context Providers Context providers are Agents that provide context to a stream by consuming reference or static data and making it available. For example, the SQL Server Context Provider provides static data to the Data Stream by reading the data in a database table and sending it to the next Agent. Listeners Listeners are Agents that listen for data or events from sensors and third-party systems. For example, the MQTT Listener listens for data from sensors as it is posted to MQTT. Transformations Transformation Agents alter the shape or form of data. For example, the Join Transformation joins data it receives from two separate data sources. AI & Machine Learning AI & Machine Learning Agents allow you to run advanced AI to transform the data. For example, Azure ML, IBM Watson, and Jupyter Notebook. Recommendations Recommendation Agents are related to Recommendations and let you complete actions such as running recommendations, updating recommendations, and more. Functions Functions perform specific mathematical or statistical operations on data. For example, the FFT Function performs forward FFT calculations on the data it receives. Settings An Agent consists of code and user settings. The code defines the actions an Agent performs in any Data Stream. The settings are the input for the code that executes, provided by the user when adding the Agent to a Data Stream, such as authentication credentials. For example, consider the SQL Server Writer Agent. The function this Agent performs in a Data Stream is to take the data it receives and write it to a table in a database. The settings a user must define for the Agent so it can do that are as follows: Name of the SQL Server instance SQL Server username Whether SQL Server authentication should be used or not SQL Server password Database to which the data should be written Whether a new table should be created or not Table to which data should be written - if the user wishes to use an existing table Name of the table that should be created if the user wants to write the data to a new table If database triggers should be fired when a record is inserted Endpoints Endpoints provide entry and exit points to the Agent. The input endpoint allows the Agent to receive data from another Agent, whereas the output endpoint enables the Agent to pass data to another Agent. They are represented on the Data Stream canvas as green rectangles. The error endpoint allows an Agent to send any error data further along a part of the stream, designed to handle data records or events that do not meet certain requirements. It is represented on the Data Stream canvas as a red rectangle. Finding Agents The search bar can be used to find any specific Agents that you may be looking for. There is a dropdown option where you can specify to search through everything in Data Stream Designer, or only for Agents. Versions Agents can keep track of their different versions. Versions of an Agent can be copied, and changes made to it can be created as a new version without affecting previous versions. See the Version article for more details on versions. Publish and Unpublish Data Streams On the Agents page, there will be a number next to the version if the agent has been used in a Data Stream. Click the number to view a list of all Data Streams that are using that Agent version. Here you can directly unpublish or publish a Data Stream. As an Admin, this is useful if you need to unpublish a Data Stream and you don't have access to it. See the How to Admin Unpublish Override article for more details. Actions on the Agent Action Description Add Adds a new Agent. Select Selects multiple Agents. Delete Deletes the Agent. Save Saves any changes made to the Agent up to this point. Discard Discards any changes made to the Agent up to this point. Delete Versions Deletes selected versions of the Agent.

    "summary": "Virtual vs Non-Virtual Agents There can be two types of Agents in Data Streams; Virtual and Non-Virtual Agents. When packaging an Agent using the Stream Integration Manager, it is important to specify if an Agent is Virtual by making sure that the Virtual checkbox is correctly ticked. Virtual Agents A Virtual Agent is an Agent that is not bound to a certain environment to be able to function, for example, the Azure SQL Listener is an Agent which can be configured anywhere as it will always have access to the globally available Azure SQL Server, which it needs to integrate with. Non-Virtual Agents An Agent can be classified as Non-Virtual if it relies on a specific environment to function. Non-Virtual Agents need to interact with a system that is only available in a specific environment, for example, the SQL Server Listener. The SQL Server Listener is an Agent that can only be configured while it is on the same local area network as the SQL Server instance it needs to connect to. As shown in the diagram above, even though both Virtual and Non-Virtual Agents ultimately run on the Stream Host, there is a considerable difference in how they are handled at design time. A Virtual Agent can be configured even if no Stream Host is online, but this is not possible for a Non-Virtual one. Virtual Agents are also very fast as the engine doesn't have to go all the way to the Stream Host to configure them and this results in a smoother user experience. Note Virtual Agents can be configured even if there is no Stream Host online, but Non-Virtual Agents require a Stream Host to be online."

    "title": "Block Styling | XMPro",
    "summary": "Block Styling When a Block is selected, it can be styled under the 'Block Styling' tab in the Toolbox. Styling can include changing the text color, background color, borders, typography, or dimensions of the Block. This allows you to customize the look and feel of the application based on themes or color palettes for your specific organization. You can also customize the style of certain actions such as hovering over or clicking a button, or changing the style for every second Block. Style Groups A Block can also be assigned to a style group where a common set of styles can be configured and applied to multiple Blocks at the same time. Certain Blocks such as content cards or cards that are dragged onto the canvas already have pre-existing style groups, such as grids. These will show up under the 'Style Group'. If you have a Style Group selected and make changes to any of the styling configurations, the styling will automatically be applied to all the Blocks that are also in that style group. For example, if two grids have a style group called box-card, and you select only one of the grids and change the background to light blue, that change will also be applied to the other grid. To make changes without affecting other blocks, deselect the style group and make the changes. You can add multiple style groups at a time. If a Block has multiple style groups and you only want to apply styling to one of them, make sure only that style group is selected when configuring new styles. If multiple style groups are selected and the styling is changed, the styling will be applied to both of them together. For example, if you have two style groups, box-card, and lightgreen, and you apply styling to both of them, that styling will only be applied to Blocks that have both box-card and lightgreen style groups. Devices Styles can also be configured for different devices. See the Devices article for more details on devices. Style Sections Dimension Style CSS Property Width width sets the width of an element.

    "summary": "Canvas The App Designer Canvas is a drag and drop editor for creating customized web pages. UI Blocks are elements or controls such as a textbox that can be dragged from the toolbox to anywhere on the Canvas. See the UI Blocks article for more details on UI Blocks. This is the functionality that allows anyone on your team to create and deploy applications without needing to be a programmer. Controls such as graphs, gauges, or charts can be populated with real-time data from different systems. For example, live data from running systems or machines can be displayed directly to the user. See the Data Integration article for more details on integrating data sources into the page. The Blocks that are added onto the Canvas are what make up the overall design of a Page for the Application. Each Page in the App has its own Canvas that can be customized, and this can be opened by going into the Application and editing the Page. Block Toolbar A Block is outlined in blue on the canvas when it is selected. A blue toolbar will appear on the top-right corner of the Block which will provide options to move, clone, or do other actions on the Block. Note that some of these only apply to certain elements that allow these functions. Action Icon Description Move Allows you to click and drag the Block to move it to a different location on the Canvas. You can also click and drag from anywhere on the Block itself, but the Block may be obscured by its children. Select Parent Selects the parent of the currently selected Block. Clone Clones the selected Block. Add Adds a new section of the Block, for example, a new tab or column. Save As Widget Saves the selected Block and its inner Blocks as a Widget, which allows this group to be re-used later. See the Widgets article for more details on Widgets. Delete Deletes the Block. Canvas Hierarchy Blocks are organized on the Canvas using a hierarchy. The Canvas itself is made up of Blocks nested under other Blocks, and this makes up the overall design of the Page. When each Block is selected, it will be outlined and can help identify what part of the hierarchy it belongs to, including all of its parent Blocks and children Blocks. For example, there could a parent Block that contains multiple Blocks inside it, to form a grid of gauges containing a different value each. The hierarchy can also be viewed as a list in the Page Layouts tab in the Toolbox. See the Page Layers article for more details on Page Layers. Data Sources You can connect Data Sources to blocks on the canvas by going to 'Data Source' under 'Block Properties'. This allows you to view data on the Page based on a connected Data Source.

    "title": "Data Integration | XMPro",
    "summary": "Data Integration Data Integration refers to connecting an Application to a source of data, be it a database, a Data Stream, a Recommendation, or something else. Data Integration is needed if you want to display any real-time or context data to the user, such as through statistics or graphs. The App has a number of Data Sources, which connect to a source of data through a connector, using the parameters defined in a Connection. App Designer Connector Connectors allow you to connect to third-party sources of data. You can assume that Connectors have already been set up by your Company Administrator. See the Connectors article for more details on Connectors. XMPro has a library of Connectors available to use. To acquire any of these Connectors, please contact your XMPro sales representative or write to us at support@xmpro.com. Alternatively, since Connectors can be written by anyone that has some knowledge of programming and has access to the required technologies, you can write your own Connector by following these instructions. Connection The parameters defined in a Connection allow the App to connect to a source of data like a SQL Database and expose the entities as Data Sources within the Page. Connection parameters can include credentials such as a username, password, path, URL, or location identifier that you can use to make a remote connection to the Data Source. For example, connection parameters to connect to an SQL Database would include the Server Name, Authentication type, Username, and password. A new App will have the Recommendations Connector and the Data Stream Connector by default. Connections are managed in an App by clicking the App Data command. Any Connections that were created with an older version of a Connector will have an upgrade icon. The properties of a Connection are dependent on the type of Connector. To see the properties of a Connection, click the Connector in the list of Connectors above. Upgrade the Connection If the Connector has a newer version, an upgrade icon will appear on the App Data list indicating that the Connection can be upgraded, and the Upgrade action will become available. This upgrades the Connection to use the latest uploaded version of the Connector. Data Source Data Sources are a link to a specific Entity in a Connection's Entities, for example, a table in a SQL database. Data Sources are managed through the Page Data tab of a Page. You can add a new Data Source by clicking on the + button to the right of the Data Sources heading, and edit a Data Source by clicking on the pencil button to the right of the Data Source. If the Connection has the ability to have Live Data Updates, the checkbox will be visible. If checked, the Data Source will automatically update the Blocks when new data becomes available without refreshing the Page. Primary Key A primary key is the column or columns that contain values that uniquely identify each row in a table. Without a primary key, we cannot update, insert or delete data in the table. The Primary Key is a required field and cannot be empty. If the selected Entity has a Primary Key it will be specified automatically in the Primary Key field otherwise it has to be specified manually by selecting one or multiple columns from the list. Data Source Validation A Data Source may become invalid due to several issues. The most common ones can be expired passwords, deleted entity or unreachable servers. If a Data Source becomes invalid a count will be visible on the Page Data tab to notify the user. If you click the Page Data tab of the page, an exclamation mark will be visible in front of the Data Source name and hovering over the exclamation mark will show a detailed error. Data Source in the Page Blocks A Data Source may be attached to many Blocks. Blocks that allow Data Sources to be attached have a section in Block Properties called Data Source. If a Data Source is applied to a Block, depending on what type of Block it is, it will either repeat itself or repeat its child elements per the number of rows of the Data Source or use the data to populate its items or visualization. For example: Repeating Blocks will display a single record in each block, and a new block will be created for every record in the data source. All blocks will be created with the same styling as the first one. Blocks that populate items will display all records in a single Block. The parameters of the Data Source are then made available to its Action if it allows one, and all its descendants' Dynamic and Quick Expression value bindings. Note See the Block Properties article for more information on Dynamic and Quick Expression values. List of Data Source Blocks The following Blocks populate their items or visualization with rows from the Data Source. Accordion Autodesk Forge Chart D3 Visualization Data Grid Dropdown Grid List Lookup Pie Chart Pivot Grid Polar Chart Radio Buttons Select Box Sparkline Tabs Tags Templated List Tree Grid Tree List Unity The following Blocks repeat themselves/create a new block for each record in the Data Source: Box & Data Repeater Box Card & Content Card Fieldset Horizontal Stacked Layout Vertical Stacked Layout Parameters If a Data Source has Input Parameters, the Parameters option will be available. Here you can add a Static or Dynamic Value to each Input Parameter. Filter A Filter may be applied to the Data Source on the Block, which will then only retrieve data that matches the Filter. You can add new conditions or groups by clicking the + button. Groups can be nested within each other to create advanced logic. In an \"And\" group, all the conditions must be true, and in an \"Or\" group, only one of the conditions must be true to trigger an Alert. As an example, in the following Filter, both of the following must be true for the data: Average must be greater than 50, And V1, V2, or V3 must be greater than 60. Sort You can sort the data by any field in ascending or descending order. Show/Skip You can choose to only retrieve a certain number of items and/or skip a certain number of items by adding values to Show # of Results and Skip # of Results. Show Default Row If the control is of the type where the block repeats itself/creates a new block for each record, the Show Default Row option will be available. This defines whether an empty row will be added at the end of the rows received from the Data Source, allowing you to insert a new row into the Data Source.

This is needed in order for you to view the way the Application looks on multiple devices, and to ensure users have a good user experience regardless of the screen size they are viewing your Application on. Responsive Design All pre-built page layouts come with predefined styles and media queries to ensure that Blocks are responsive on different devices. When using a pre-built layout, the positions of the Blocks will automatically change when switching between desktop, tablet, and mobile in order to fit everything comfortably on the page regardless of the screen width. Configuring Desktop, Tablets, and Phones Changes such as block styling made to desktop devices are automatically applied to devices of all sizes. Changes made to tablet devices affect screens smaller than 1366 pixels, and changes made to mobile mode affect screens smaller than 896 pixels. If a different style is configured for both desktop and mobile mode, the mobile mode style will override the styles of larger devices when viewing in mobile mode. The same applies to the tablet.

If you set a container to display: flex;, its child items' width or height will be expanded or shrunk to best fill the space available. The direction the flex items will be stacked in is determined by the flex-direction property. The options include row, row-reverse, column, and column-reverse. The alignment of the items in the main-axis (horizontal if flex-direction is row or row-reverse, vertical if flex-direction is column or column-reverse) is determined by the justify-content property. The options include flex-start, flex-end, space-between, space-around, and center. The alignment of the items in the cross-axis (vertical if flex-direction is row or row-reverse, horizontal if flex-direction is column or column-reverse) is determined by the align-items property. The options include flex-start, flex-end, stretch, and center. The child items of a flex container have a say in how they are altered. The flex-grow property on the child of a flex container defines whether the item should be the desired ratio of this item compared to its siblings. The flex-shrink property defines how much a flex item will shrink relative to the rest of the flex items. Best used in conjunction with the flex-basis property.

It enables subject matter experts to create and deploy real-time, event intelligence applications without being a programmer. This means that Engineers and subject matter experts can build apps in days or weeks without further overloading IT, enabling your organization to accelerate and scale your digital transformation. Applications are accessed through the App Designer Categories dashboard or the Applications button on the left menu. Finding Applications The search bar can be used to find any specific Apps that you may be looking for. There is a dropdown option where you can specify to search through everything in App Designer, or only for Apps. Overview Applications are grouped into categories, which are selected in the App properties. They are displayed on the App Designer home page dashboard and in the Applications list under their category. The dashboard shows the Apps' name, description, and icon as well as the publish status and date last modified. Applications have a Default Theme, which is the theme selected when any new pages are created. Each page can have its own theme. Page An Application is made up of one or more Pages. A Page is a web page within the Application that can be built using the no-code App Designer. The Application starts with a Landing Page, which acts as the main home page and is the first page to open when a user opens the application. Users can edit Pages or build the content on the webpage by selecting and dragging Blocks such as controls or text onto a Canvas. An application can then be launched in order to see a preview of what the Application would look like during runtime. Pages can also be configured to display real-time or contextual data directly from a source of data, such as a database, Data Stream, or Recommendation. This can be done using Data Integration. Pages can also be configured to navigate to other pages, where data can also be passed between pages using parameters. See the Page article for more information on pages. Versions Different versions of Applications can be made to keep track of any major or minor changes made. Versions of an application can be opened by selecting the 'Versions' tab when editing the application. Viewing a particular version will open the application for that version. Copying a version allows you to continue working and making changes to the application while maintaining a version of it before you made changes, which can also act as a backup mechanism. See the Version article for more information on versions. Access An Application can be shared with other users. The person who originally created the Application will be listed as the owner and can never lose his/her right to access it unless it is deleted.

What the numbers represent is as follows: The number of published Apps or Data Streams. The number of unpublished Apps or Data Streams. Default Category The Data Stream Designer or App Designer will have one Category defined after it is initially installed, called \"My Sandbox\". This Category is used as a default Category as there is a requirement for all Data Streams or Apps to belong to a Category. In terms of the Application, no Data Stream or Application is allowed to exist if it doesn't belong to a Category. After installing Data Stream Designer or App Designer, you can create any Category you like. However, when the default Category is left empty (not containing any Data Streams or Apps), it will not display on the landing page after at least one other Category is created.

    "title": "Collection and Stream Host | XMPro",
    "summary": "Collection and Stream Host Note It is recommended that you read this documentation along with the articles listed below to improve your understanding of how Stream Hosts and Collections work. Agents Data Stream Processing Overview Watch the video below for an introduction to Stream Hosts and Collections, and their role in enabling scalable real-time data processing. Whether you're overseeing a few assets or thousands, stream hosts and collections provide the flexibility, efficiency, and scalability needed to transform your data operations. Video 1: How XMPro Stream Hosts and Collections Enable Scalable, Real-Time Data Processing Stream Hosts A Stream Host is an application that can be installed as a Docker container, a Windows Service, or a Console Application. Stream Hosts enable Data Streams to run and execute actions and are also responsible for getting the configurations of Non-Virtual Agents. In other words, the Stream Host application needs to be running for Agents in a Data Stream to process the data, according to the design of the Stream. Both Virtual and Non-Virtual Agents essentially run on a Stream Host, but how they are handled at design time differs greatly. Non-Virtual Agents require a Stream Host to be online for Data Stream Designer to be able to get their configurations, but Virtual Agents don't need a Stream Host to be running. Collections Stream Hosts are grouped into different Collections, which are created and maintained in Data Stream Designer. A Collection can be defined as a Category that contains a set of Stream Hosts that run the same Data Streams. Each Stream Host is associated with a Collection by keeping the ID of the Collection in the appsettings.json file of the Stream Host, which can be found in the location where the Stream Host has been installed. Thus, all the Stream Hosts that have the same Collection ID stored in this file, will automatically fall under the Collection that has that ID. After creating a Collection within Data Stream Designer, you can associate a Data Stream with a default Collection. Unless changes are made for individual Agents in your Data Stream, each Agent will use this Collection to perform the actions it was designed to perform. However, Data Stream Designer allows you to build a stream in which some Agents use one Collection and others use a different Collection. For more information on how to configure this, click here. Along with the Collection ID, the appsettings.json file contains other configurations for the Stream Host. Each of these configurations are listed and described in the table below. Property Description ID Uniquely identifies the Stream Host. Name Name of the Stream Host. Collection ID ID of the Collection associated with the Stream Host. Rank Indicator of the preference given to the Stream Host. This especially applies when more than one Stream Host with the same Collection ID is running. The Stream Host with the lowest rank will be used to get the configurations of Non-Virtual Agents. The rank has a default value of 0. See Stream Host Rank. Secret Used to verify the connection between the Stream Host and the Collection. This field needs to correspond to the Key that is stored for a Collection in Data Stream Designer. If this key is revoked/replaced, all Stream Hosts will be disconnected. Server URL URL that the Stream Host needs to use to connect to Data Stream Designer. Cryptography key Key that the Stream Host will use to encrypt or decrypt secure user settings, for example, a SQL Server Password. The table below contains a list of the configurations stored for a Collection along with a description for each. This information can be found by opening the Collections page from the left-hand menu in Data Stream Designer and selecting your Collection from the list. Please note that the only field you will not be able to change is the ID of the Collection. Property Description ID Uniquely identifies the Collection. Key Used to verify the connection between the host and Data Stream Designer. If this key is revoked/replaced, all Stream Hosts will be disconnected. Name Name of the Collection. Remote Receiver See Remote Receivers and Publishers. Remote Publisher See Remote Receivers and Publishers. Metadata Tags that have been added to the Collection. Publish and Unpublish Data Streams On the Collections page, click More and Data Streams to view a list of all Data Streams that are using a given Collection. Here you can directly unpublish or publish a Data Stream. As an Admin, this is useful if you need to unpublish a Data Stream and you don't have access to it. See the How to Admin Unpublish Override article for more details. Finding Collections The search bar can be used to find any specific Collections that you may be looking for. There is a dropdown option where you can specify to search through everything in Data Stream Designer, or only for Collections. Actions on the Collection Action Description New Adds a new Collection. Select Selects multiple Collections. Delete Deletes the selected Collections. Save Saves any changes made to the Collection up to this point. Discard Discards any changes made to the Collection up to this point. Stream Hosts Opens a new page with a list of hosts that have installed this Collection. Connection Profile Download the Connection Profile used in the installation of a Stream Host. Download Host Download the installation file for the selected platform. Variables Manage the Collection's Variables. Data Streams Opens a new page with a list of all Data Streams in the selected Collection. Revoke Key Revokes the current key and will generate a new one. Hosts that are using the revoked key will be unable to connect until their configuration is manually updated. Delete Deletes the selected Collection. Remote Receivers and Publishers The Remote Receiver and Remote Publisher properties are used to bridge the gap between Agents in a stream that is associated with different Collections, for example: Consider having a stream that has two Agents: Listener_A, which is associated with Collection_A, and Action_Agent_B, which is associated with Collection_B Listener_A needs to communicate to Action_Agent_B, but they belong to different Collections. As a result, the engine will automatically use the Remote Receiver and Publisher to pass data from one Collection to another. Please note that only MQTT is currently supported for this functionality. Example: Consider a stream that has the following Agents: Event Simulator Event Printer For the purpose of this example, the Event Simulator will be named ES_1 and the Event Printer EP_1, where ES_1 is using Collection_A and EP_1 is using Collection_B. Since these two Agents are using two different Collections, data flow from ES_1 to EP_1 is not possible as there is no physical connection (the Stream Hosts in these Collections can be on different machines in different parts of the world). To solve this problem and allow data flow from ES_1 to EP_1, the Collection EP_1 is using needs to be set up as follows: The Remote Receiver for Collection_B needs to be set to MQTT and the broker address needs to be specified. The Remote Publisher for Collection_B needs to be set to MQTT and the broker address needs to be specified. When the stream is published now, the data simulated by ES_1 will be published to MQTT, which will enable the engine to get the data EP_1 expects by listening for it on MQTT. Thus, data flow between ES_1 and EP_1 has been established. The below image is an example of the configuration for Collection_B. Connection Profiles Overview A Connection Profile is a file, containing certain details about a Collection, that can be downloaded from Data Stream Designer. The purpose of this file is to make the installation process of Stream Hosts easier by providing you with an option to upload this file to the Stream Host installer instead of manually specifying the Collection information. This file contains the values described in the table below. Property Description Device Name Name of the Stream Host. This name will be the same as the device name that needs to be specified when downloading a Collection Profile. If you install the Stream Host as a Windows Service, the service name and device name will be the same. Collection ID The ID of the Collection the Stream Host will be associated with. Secret Used to verify the connection between the stream host and the Collection. If this key is revoked/replaced, all stream hosts will be disconnected. Server URL URL that the Stream Host needs to use to connect to Data Stream Designer. This is the URL of the instance of Data Stream Designer that has been installed on the server. Key Key used to encrypt or decrypt user settings. Download a connection profile To download an installation profile, follow the steps below: Open the Collections page from the left-hand menu. Select the Collection you would like to install the Stream Host for. Click Connection Profile. Enter a Device Name. Click OK. The download will start automatically. Stream Host Installation To install a Stream Host, please refer to these instructions. Set Log Level The Log Level determines the type of information or level of detail that will be logged. The two Log Levels are Trace and Info. Info The Info Log level is the default Log Level. This will only log Info level messages or logs, which include details on when a Stream Host is starting or stopping. Any errors related to Connections or the Stream Host itself will also be logged at this level. Trace The Trace Log level will log more detailed messages and errors about the Data Stream or specific Agents themselves. This is very useful for debugging as it can log information about what is happening inside the code itself, such as which methods are being called and when. Using the Trace Log Level for a long period of time can take up a lot of space on the hard drive. Selecting the Trace Log Level will log both Trace and Info Level Logs. Stream Host Rank All the Stream Hosts contained in a Collection will be used to run the Data Streams associated with that Collection. However, you can choose which Stream Host should be responsible for getting the configurations of Non-Virtual agents. The rank given to a Stream Host defines what preference the Stream Host will be given in such a scenario. The Stream Host with the lowest rank will be picked by the system. All Stream Hosts will always have a default rank value of 0. Example Consider having a Data Stream with the following Agents: MQTT listener Filter transformation SQL Server Writer The purpose of this Data Stream is to get temperature readings from a sensor on a machine, filter the readings that are higher than 120°C and write these values to a table in a SQL Server database. All three agents are configured to use Stream Hosts in the \"Mine 09\" Collection to run (see image below). However, to get the user settings for the SQL Server Writer Action Agent, which is a Non-Virtual Agent, Data Stream Designer will pick and use the first Stream Host available. This can be changed by setting the rank of the Stream Host you want to use to be lower than the other Stream Hosts that are available. Further Reading How to Create and Manage Collections"

    "title": "Connector | XMPro",
    "summary": "Connector Overview A Connector is a pre-built integration plug-in for the XMPro App Designer that allows you to connect to third-party data sources without writing code. They can be used when integrating data from data sources such as a database into an Application. This can include real-time data from machines, websites, other streaming data, or contextual data such as the make or model of a certain item. Connectors are useful if you want to use the data within an Application or display the data to the user on a page of an Application. Data Sources can include databases, Data Streams, or Recommendations. See the Data Integration article for more details. You can assume that Connectors have already been set up by your Administrator. Each Connector consists of code, settings, and other properties that are packaged into a file that can be uploaded to App Designer. XMPro has a library of Connectors available to use. To acquire any of these Connectors, please contact your XMPro sales representative or write to us at support@xmpro.com. Alternatively, since Connectors can be written by anyone that has some knowledge of programming and has access to the required technologies, you can write your own Connector by following these instructions. Category Connectors can be grouped into categories. This category is separate from the App and Data Stream Categories. Settings A Connector consists of code and user settings. The code defines the actions a Connector performs in App Designer. The settings are the input for the code that executes, provided by the user when adding the Connector to App Designer, such as authentication credentials. For example, consider the SQL Server Connector, which retrieves data from a SQL database. The settings a user must define for the Connector so it can do that are as follows: Name of the SQL Server instance SQL Server username Whether SQL Server authentication should be used or not SQL Server password Database to which the data should be written Finding Connectors The search bar can be used to find any specific Connectors that you may be looking for. There is a dropdown option where you can specify to search through everything in App Designer, or only for Connectors. Adding a Connector Connectors can be added by uploading their XMP file on the connectors page. Each version of a Connector has its own XMP file. When uploading an app, any missing Connectors that the app needs must be updated or uploaded for the app to be imported successfully. Versions Connectors can have multiple versions. For example, a new version of a Connector can be created if there are any changes or updates made to it. Changes or updates made to new versions of a Connector will not affect the previous versions. Each version of a Connector has its own XMP file. When uploading a Connector, a specific version of that Connector will be uploaded. To upload a different version, you will need to upload the XMP file for that specific version you want to use. When you view a Connector, you can see the list of specific versions for that Connector. The number of apps using each version is shown next to the version number. Apps that you do not have access to will not show on the list. When you upload a new version, the new version will be displayed in this list. When selecting a Connector to use in an app, the application will automatically choose the latest version available. Note When a new version of a Connector is uploaded, any apps using older versions may need to be upgraded. See the Data Integration article for more information on how to upgrade an app's connection. View and Edit Applications There is an alternate way to view or edit Applications directly from the Connectors page. When viewing a Connector, you will see the number of Applications using each version of the Connector. Expand to see the full list of Applications, which can be viewed by clicking on the Application or edited by clicking the Edit button. Publish and Unpublish Apps You can also publish or unpublish an Application that uses that version of the Connector. As an Admin, this is useful if you need to unpublish an Application and you don't have access to it. See the How to Admin Unpublish Override article for more details. Actions on the Connector Action Description Add Adds a new Connector. Select Selects multiple Connectors. Delete Deletes the Connector. Manage Categories Creates and edits categories to organize the Connectors. These categories are separate from the App and Data Stream Categories. Save Saves any changes made to the Connector up to this point. Discard Discards any changes made to the Connector up to this point. Delete Versions Deletes a selected version of a Connector. You can only delete versions that don't have any apps using that version of the Connector. If you don't have access to an app that a version is using, you still cannot delete the version.

    "summary": "Data Stream A Data Stream is a visual display of data flow, letting you integrate and connect various systems or data sources to view your information. This includes real-time data from machines, websites, or other streaming sources, as well as contextual data like an item's make or model. The Data Stream Designer lets you see all connected data in one place and manipulate it in different ways, such as aggregating, filtering, displaying, or saving to another database. You can monitor data to spot critical events like machine failures, without needing coding skills. Video Presentation Discussing Data Stream Designer Data Stream's flow is represented by agents connected by arrows, enabling data processing at each agent based on its function, allowing you to view and perform actions on data from multiple sources in one place. Note We recommend reading this documentation in conjunction with the Agent article to enhance your understanding of data streams. Finding Data Streams Use the search bar to find specific Data Streams, and select from the dropdown menu to search either throughout Data Stream Designer or only for Data Streams. Data Stream Type The Type selected in the Properties affects your choice of how often and when polling-based Agents run. Streaming (Default): This allows you to specify a Polling Interval in seconds on polling-based Agents in the Stream Object configuration. Polling starts immediately and continues indefinitely. Recurring: This allows you to specify granular options to schedule polling-based Agents in the Stream Object configuration. Options allow you to control the start time, repetition interval, and end time or number of repetitions. There is also the option to repeat indefinitely. Agent Event Queue Capacity v4.4.17: Replaced 'Event Buffer' for clarity in understanding how many events are buffered. The Data Stream includes an advanced option to manage high event volumes, or complex stream configurations. The Agent Event Queue Capacity property allows for a higher number of events to be queued for each Stream Object within the Data Stream reducing the risk of event loss. By default, the Agent Event Queue Capacity is set to 128 events per Stream Object. Warning Increasing the Agent Event Queue Capacity may result in the Stream Host consuming more memory. The Canvas Data streams are crafted in an interactive canvas, allowing you to drag agents from the toolbox to the drawing area. In the same environment, configure agent settings, manage versions, define business cases, and more. Stream Objects on the canvas can be duplicated or deleted, and for easy identification and access, they're marked with a unique color and abbreviation. The Toolbox The toolbox is a component in the Data Stream Designer that allows you to choose an Agent from a library of Agents that have been uploaded to the system and drag the agent from the toolbox to the Canvas when building a stream. All agents in the toolbox will always be the latest version and will all be available for all users, regardless of their role, unless a user does not have permission to view any of the Agents. Agents are grouped by category in the toolbox. To expand a category, click on the arrow next to the category name. Please note that if no agents in a particular category are uploaded, the entire category will be hidden. Thus, if you are missing some of the categories in the toolbox, it is likely that there aren't any Agents uploaded belonging to that category.

    "title": "Stream Object Configuration | XMPro",
    "summary": "Stream Object Configuration Data Stream and Agent Configuration User Settings All Agents will individually be associated with a Collection. This Collection may or may not be different from the default Collection set for your Data Stream. This setting will always be listed among the rest of the user settings. There are a number of Agents that do not require any settings, for example, the Event Printer Agent. This Agent simply prints events and you do not need to specify settings such as a server URL, username, password, or upload a file. Other Agents, however, require settings to be filled in before you can successfully run the stream. For example, consider having a CSV listener Agent in your Data Stream. The CSV listener Agent will require you to specify the following values: Specify a polling interval (seconds) Upload a CSV file Specify the CSV definition (name of each column in the CSV file along with what data type the values in each column are) If these values have been provided correctly, the data will be read from the CSV file you specified when you publish your stream. Input Mapping and Arrow Configuration Some Agents allow inputs to be mapped if the Require Input Map property has been set to true during packaging. What Input Mapping allows you to do is to specify that a specific Agent receives its input in a specific structure. This causes the arrows leading to an Agent to be made configurable and will allow the user to map the inputs of an agent to incoming attributes, for example: Consider having the following Agents in a stream: CSV Listener SQL Server Writer The CSV Listener is configured to get data from a file that contains the following headings: Timestamp (of type DateTime) ReadingNo (of type Long) Temperature_A01 (of type Double) Vibration_A01 (of type Double) Result (of type Double) The task the SQL Server Writer needs to perform is to write the data it receives to a SQL Server database, but it expects the structure of the data to be in a specific format. The table we need to write the data to has the following columns: ID (bigint, identity column) ReadingNo (bigint) Temperature (float) Vibration (float) Results (float) Timestamp (datetime) For the data to be written to the database in a specific format, you need to map the correct columns in the CSV file to the correct SQL Server table columns. To do this, both the CSV Listener and the SQL Server Writer Agents need to be configured first. To configure an Agent, click on the Agent and then on the “Configure” button. Fill in all the details required, for example, the SQL Server instance name and credentials. Next, you can go ahead and configure the Input Mapping by clicking on the arrow that connects the CSV Listener and the SQL Server Writer Agents. Then, click on “Configure“. Choose which column should be mapped to which column by selecting the correct value from the drop-down menu for each row. Please note that the data types of the items being mapped to each other need to be the same. If not, the value in the left column will be disabled and you will not be able to select it. Remember that, even though the same principle applies to all Agents, input mapping might be done differently for different Agents. Mapping Functions In some cases, you might have to map a large number of inputs for an Agent. Some functions have been implemented to make the process of mapping a large number of fields easier, such as Match by Expression, AutoMap, and Show Unmapped. AutoMap By clicking on the “AutoMap” button, Data Stream Designer will match all the fields that are common between the Agents involved, for example, if you look at the stream in the image below, you will notice that both the SQL Server Writer Agent and the CSV Listener has the fields listed below in common, which will automatically be mapped if they have the same data type. ReadingNo Timestamp Match by Expression The Match by Expression function allows for an expression to be used to make mapping a large number of fields easier and quicker. The fields can be mapped by using any of the following options: Prefix Postfix Expression The Prefix option allows you to specify that columns should be matched based on the first part of a column name, for example: In the CSV listener Agent, there is a column named “A01_Temperature“ In the SQL Server Writer Agent, there is a column named “Temperature“ In the images below, “A01” is specified as the postfix. Based on the prefix given, the column “A01_Temperature” in the CSV Listener can be matched to the column “Temperature” in the SQL Server Writer Agent. The Postfix option allows you to specify that columns should be matched based on the last part of a column name, for example, In the file uploaded to the CSV listener Agent, there are columns named “Temperature_A01“ and “Vibration_A01“ In the table referenced in the SQL Server Writer Agent configurations, there are columns named “Temperature“ and “Vibration“ In the images below, “_A01” is specified as the postfix. Based on the postfix given, the columns “Temperature_A01“ and “Vibration_A01“ in the CSV Listener can be matched to the columns “Temperature“ and “Vibration“ in the SQL Server Writer Agent. The Expression option allows you to use a regular expression to match the columns, for example, In the file uploaded to the CSV Listener Agent, there is a column named “Device_Temperature_Fahrenheit“ In the table referenced in the SQL Server Writer Agent configurations, there is a column named “Temperature“ In the images below, “Device_$1_Fahrenheit” is used as the regular expression. Based on this expression, the column “Device_Temperature_Fahrenheit” in the CSV listener is mapped to the column “Temperature” in the SQL Server Writer Agent. Show Unmapped The Show Unmapped function allows you to filter the rows displayed, based on if the columns have been mapped. If you chose to filter items based on if they are mapped or not, all the records that haven’t been mapped yet will be listed, for example, In the image below, “ReadingNo” and “Timestamp” have been mapped for both Agents using the AutoMap function. However, there are three records that remain that need to be mapped. In some scenarios, there might be a lot more records with some being mapped and others not.

    "summary": "Timeline History: Timeline Changes to a Data Stream are recorded and stored in the database so that the user can view a history of any changes made by themselves or others. This can therefore be used as a collaboration tool to see the changes users make (even if it's only a single user), as well as notes about things that need to be addressed. These changes can be viewed from the canvas by clicking the \"Timeline\" button. Every time an event occurs, it will be added to a timeline in the form of a block, displaying the following: The time and date the change occurred. The name of the person who made the change. The area where the change was made, for example, \"Tags\". The description of the change. Adding Notes Most of the items added to the timeline are added by the system itself, for example, if the version of the Stream increased or if someone changed a setting or configuration of one of the Agents. However, occasionally you may want to add an explanatory notes to the timeline. Filtering The timeline can be filtered in two ways: the type of event logged and the context. Examples of event types are changes made to Agents or version numbers that have been increased. Each type is named after the element on which the change was made. The types of events that can be filtered are as follows: Agent Attributes Canvas Configure Note Publish Share Tag Unpublish Version You can also filter by context, i.e. you can view all changes, or only the events that apply to a specific version. Canvas changes apply to a version, whereas sharing access or changing attributes apply to the data stream as a whole. Further Reading How to Manage the Timeline"

    "title": "Data Delivery Insights | XMPro",
    "summary": "Data Delivery Insights Stream Hosts Foundational Premise: Streaming Signals for Event Intelligence Back to Basics The premise of a Stream Host is to ingest streaming signals as messages into the Data Stream. The premise for a Data Stream is the capability to ingest a fire hose and achieve the desired outcome even if not all the data elements are delivered. Consider how this contrasts with an ETL system. Neither has a primary goal of guaranteed delivery. What this means If a value (e.g. a temperature reading) in the Data Stream is measured against a rule value and a call to action is created when a threshold is reached, there is no impact if the Data Stream misses some readings. These misses could occur for several reasons, one of which is buffering. There are buffers in the Data Stream, but if they overflow and values are missed, the premise is intact. In scenarios where multiple transactions occur concurrently, the Stream Host processes the first transaction and buffers the next. However, if the buffer reaches maximum capacity and another transaction is received, the Stream Host will drop the subsequent transaction to prevent potential bottlenecks. Guaranteed Delivery – Processing Files There are circumstances where there needs to be a guarantee for the delivery of the data and the ‘dropping’ of data is unsuitable for the use case. In these circumstances, the design should adopt a pattern that ensures auditable delivery. Explanation If there is a single batch, data is split into 80 separate messages by an agent within the Data Stream, however, the next agent processes the data significantly more slowly than the previous agent which causes buffering to occur, with 80 messages coming through almost immediately the SH is unable to buffer some messages and therefore drops them. Recent Improvement The v4.4.0 release includes a Stream Host with superior \"buffer\" functionality. The new Window Agent supports a delay in transmitting events to the next Agent in a Data Stream. This enhancement aims to mitigate the risk of excessive event data buffering within the Stream Host. The flow of events can be regulated to prevent potential overload scenarios, ensuring smoother data processing and system stability. Data Stream Design Considerations and Patterns When discussing the Data Stream design there are other considerations that, by way of example, point to how patterns could be applied as the design depends on the data profile and orchestrating the data. Not all ingested messages are processed Introduce a mechanism to allocate batch IDs to ensure a message is processed. This relies on tracking individual messages outside the Data Stream (e.g. in a SQL table). If configured correctly, this can avoid duplication if a message is re-processed. Another consideration could be to split the Data Stream and use storage (e.g. SQL) to process each message/record individually: Data Stream 1 ingests the message and saves it as a record in a table. Data Stream 2 then processes each record row by row. Introduce a delay Introduce a delay in the Data Stream by including a “delay” Agent during processing to ensure messages are completely processed before a new message is received. Small polling interval When the polling interval of the listener is small (e.g. 5 or 10 seconds), the short time frame usually results in a Data Stream that is less performant. Consider a longer polling interval. A general observation is that when event intelligence monitors for asset failure, subject to certain use cases, a polling interval of 3600 seconds (i.e. one hour) is sufficient to timeously perceive degradation.

Permissions are given to users only based on what they need to do, for example, someone who only needs to view something can be given read access. This can hide additional functionality that users do not need and also protect against unintentional tampering. Whether or not you can design a particular data stream, application, or other XMPro Objects is determined by the permissions that you have on it. The person that originally created the XMPro Object will be listed as the owner and can never lose his/her right to access it unless it is deleted. Other users can then be assigned read or read-and-write access. Grant Permissions Granting permissions makes it easier for multiple users to collaborate on one particular XMPro Object. It also makes it easier to grant permissions to multiple users who are only allowed to view or read it without making changes, possibly to just give feedback or to discuss part of the XMPro Object. Permissions: Owner The Owner has full permission to make any changes required to the XMPro Object. The owner is also allowed to give other users access or change the permissions of existing users. Permissions: Co-Owner The Co-Owner has full permission to make any changes required to the XMPro Object. The Co-Owner is also allowed to give other users or change the permissions of existing users, except removing or changing the Owner's permissions.

    "summary": "Recommendation Alert Recommendation Alerts are advanced alerts that are triggered when real-time data meets the criteria defined in a Recommendation Rule. They notify you when certain conditions occur in your data and provide decision support for how to take action. The Recommendation Alerts are found by clicking on the Recommendations button in the menu on the left of the App Designer. The grid provides an overview of all the Alerts that you have access to. The rightmost Status column shows whether the Alert is Pending or Resolved. You can order, filter by specific values, search the alerts by any of the columns, and search in all columns in the Search bar. To see Resolved as well as Pending Alerts, check the \"Show Archived\" checkbox. Click on an Alert in the grid to navigate to the Recommendation Alert details. Finding Recommendation Alerts The search bar can be used to find any specific Recommendation Alerts that you may be looking for. There is a dropdown option where you can specify to search through everything in App Designer, or only for Recommendation Alerts. Detailed View The Recommendation Alert page provides details of the alert. It allows you to input information into the Form, view Triage Instructions, have a Discussion with your team, and see the alert Timeline and Analytics. Headline The headline of the Alert. Generated by the Rule Headline. Recommendation Details A paragraph on the details of the Alert. Generated by the Rule Description. Event Data The data received by the Data Stream. If \"Log Data On All Occurrences\" is checked in the Rule, this data will be updated as new data is received. Notes An area to write notes and observations. Actions This area contains the actions that can be performed on a Recommendation Alert. Assign and Reassign Reassign added in v4.4.4 Ability to Assign (or Reassign) responsibility for the Recommendation Alert to a user that has run access to the Recommendation. The default selection is the logged-in user. When this action is performed, the action is recorded on the Timeline and in the Discussion - thus notifying the assignee. Share Ability to share the Recommendation Alert to users that have run access to the Recommendation. Selected users will receive an email with the note and a link to the Recommendation Alert. Save Saves the changes made on the Recommendation Alert. Mark as False Positive Someone reviewed the issue, determined that the asset doesn't have an issue or it was triggered while in Maintenance/Service mode, and considered the matter closed. Mark as Resolved Someone reviewed the issue, took mitigation steps, and considered the matter resolved. Form A form where relevant information can be entered. It is only available if the Recommendation has an attached Form. Accessed by clicking on the Form tab. For more details on how to add actions to a form button, see Recommendation Actions. Triage Instructions An area that provides useful information on actions to take to resolve the Alert and links to relevant resources. It is only available if the Recommendation has Triage Instructions enabled. Accessed by clicking on the Triage Instructions tab.

    "summary": "Scoring What is Alert Ranking and Alert Scoring? When setting up a Recommendation, authors are able to influence the order in which Alerts will be shown. Ranking and Scoring help the alert recipient prioritize recommendations according to their importance. What is the difference between Alert Ranking and Alert Scoring? Alert Ranking allows users to rank a recommendation as High/Medium/Low. Alert Scoring is an alternate fine-tuning of the alert ranking by specific factors such as recommendation, category, rule, and an optional value from the Data Stream. By allowing the author to assign a calculated score to an Alert instead of a ranking, you can have even more detailed control over its importance level. This Score also helps the alert recipient to understand its relative importance. {% hint style=\"info\" %} Authors still have the option to use Alert Ranking instead of Alert Scoring if they prefer. {% endhint %} How is the scoring calculated? This feature allows recommendation authors to assign numerical values (1-10) to various aspects during configuration. These values are then multiplied, resulting in an alert score. score = recommendation factor * category factor * rule factor * optional factor The score is calculated at the time the alert is generated and is not recalculated should any of the factors be updated. Where are scoring values added? The values used to score an Alert could be configured in these different areas: Recommendation – assesses the significance of the recommendation itself Recommendation Category – evaluates the importance of the recommendation's category Recommendation Rule - when managing a rule within a recommendation Recommendation Optional - an Optional Rule Factor value retrieved from the Data Stream. Viewing the recommendation scoring When viewing the Recommendation Alerts list, The Recommendation Scoring is displayed on the Score Column, and the Alerts are arranged in a descending order based on their Scoring. You can also view the Scores using the Score Factor Matrix. To open the Score Factor Matrix: Open Manage Recommendations Click on “More” ellipses Click the \"Score Factor Matrix\" button {% hint style=\"info\" %} This table only shows an estimate as the Optional Factor of the Recommendation could not be determined until the Alert is generated. {% endhint %} Viewing the Score Factor history on a timeline The changes made on a Score Factor Recommendation can be viewed on a timeline in the following areas: Category Timeline – when observing score factor changes within this timeline. Recommendation & Rule Timeline – when viewing score factor changes within this timeline."

    "summary": "Rule A Rule defines the conditions for triggering a Recommendation Alert and what the created Recommendation Alert should look like. Multiple Rules can also be grouped into one Recommendation. Rule Logic Data sent from the selected Data Stream is passed through the Rule Logic and if the conditions created are met by the data, a new Recommendation Alert will be created. You can add new conditions or groups by clicking the + button. Groups can be nested within each other to create advanced logic. In an \"And\" group, all the conditions must be true, and in an \"Or\" group, only one of the conditions must be true to trigger an Alert. As an example, in the following Rule Logic, both of the following must be true to trigger an Alert: Average must be greater than 50, And V1, V2, or V3 must be greater than 60. Alert Headline & Description This refers to the headline and description that the Recommendation Alert will be created with. Any tag (starting with @) will be replaced with the value output from the Data Stream. Alert Ranking The priority level that the Recommendation Alert will be created with. Priority level determines the order in which the Alerts will be displayed. Impact Metric The measurable impact of the business event detected by the Recommendation Rule. This will be shown on Alerts in the Recommendation Block in App Pages. Enable Form A flag that determines whether the Recommendation Alert will be created with a Form. Select Form The Form that the Recommendation Alert will be created with. Form Version The Version of the Form that the Recommendation Alert will be created with. Additional Recommendation Management Column An additional column in the Recommendation Alerts grid. Any tag (starting with @) will be replaced with the value entered in the corresponding field in the Form. Resolution Resolution determines whether new data from the Data Stream will automatically resolve the Recommendation Alert if the Rule Logic is no longer true. Manual Resolution: A user must manually resolve each Recommendation. Automatic Resolution: Recommendation auto resolves when trigger conditions are no longer true. This may impact performance, as it might continuously trigger and resolve a large number of Recommendations at a time if the data fluctuates frequently. Recurrence Recurrence determines whether new data from the Data Stream will create new Recommendation Alerts if a Pending Recommendation Alert already exists and the Rule Logic is true. If the conditions created by the Rule Logic are met by the data, and if Recurrence is set to All Occurrences or First Occurrence and no Pending Alert exists, a new Recommendation Alert will be created. First Occurrence: The current recommendation must be resolved before others can be triggered for the same rule. All Occurrences: A new recommendation will be triggered every time the rule conditions are true. Recurrence will be disabled and be considered to be the First Occurrence if the Recommendation has Execution Order enabled. Log Data On Determines whether new data from the Data Stream will log new data in the Event Data grid if the Rule Logic is true. First Occurrence: Current recommendation will only log data on the first occurrence. All Occurrences: New alert data will be triggered every time the rule conditions are true. Triage Instructions Instructions to help whoever is resolving the Recommendation Alert. Enable Triage Instructions is a flag that determines whether the Recommendation Alert will be created with Triage Instructions. Resources A list of links on the Recommendation Alert to help whoever is resolving the Recommendation Alert. Enable Resources is a flag that determines whether the Recommendation Alert will be created with Resources. Notifications This refers to the list of Notifications that will be sent out to everyone who is subscribed. View Related Alerts You can view Alerts that are directly related to a Rule.

    "summary": "End-To-End Use Case Note This Use Case assumes the XMPro platform is installed and configured, or you are using the Free Trial that has everything set up for you. This step-by-step tutorial is meant to be an introduction to using the XMPro platform. Completing it will give you a solid foundation to understand the more advanced concepts and detailed how-to guides. This tutorial will explain how to create and design a Data Stream, configure Stream Objects to ingest, analyze, transform, and perform actions on data. You will also learn how to set up a Recommendation to generate alerts based on rule logic, create and design an App, create Data Sources and Connections, and configure a simple Data Grid and Chart. Warning Please note that the XMPro platform requires third-party cookies to be enabled on your browser. Use Case Let's assume there is a power plant that uses a heat exchanger to keep the turbine cool and at the optimum temperature. The heat exchanger circulates water between the cooling tower and the heat exchanger to dissipate heat. To keep a proper circulation of liquid, there are three pumps [A, B, C] installed. Each Pump has a sensor that provides live data for Flow Rate (L/m) and Temperature (°C) using MQTT. Unless the Pump is under maintenance the Flow Rate should be above 15000 L/m and Water temperature should be below 130°C. Engineers should be alerted if the average flow rate falls below 250 L/s. If the average temperature starts to rise above 130°C then a critical level alert should be raised. Engineers should be provided a view to check the history of pump telemetry, maintenance records, and reservoir level to enable them to take necessary action. 1. Design Data Streams with Real-Time Data Sources The Use Case requires that we gather the Flow Rate and Temperature data from three pumps constantly, and pass it on to be analyzed and have actions performed on the data. We will achieve this with the use of Data Streams. A Data Stream is a visual representation of a flow of data. It is created through the Data Stream Designer. To access the Data Stream Designer, log into your XMPro Account and press the button in the top-left corner of the screen and click on the Data Stream Designer item. A Data Stream has four components: Ingesting data through Listener Agents Contextualizing sensor data/telemetry through Context Provider Agents Analyzing and transforming data through Transformation and AI Agents Performing actions or outputting data to other integrations through Recommendation and Action Agents We will follow those four steps below. Read & Wrangle Live and Context Data In this section, we will simulate reading data from pump sensors and a metadata store, and combine the data together into a single flow. Note See the Data Stream Concept article for more information on Data Streams. To begin, we will need to create a new Data Stream. To create a Data Stream, follow the steps below: Open the New Data Stream page from the left-hand menu. Give the Data Stream a name. For example, \"Pump Condition Monitoring\" Select the Type \"Streaming\". Data Streams of the Streaming type will run polling Agents at a set interval, for instance, every 10 seconds, whereas Recurrent Data Streams run on a customizable schedule, for instance, once a day at 12am. The recurring type only applies to polling-based Stream Objects, which we won't use in this example. Select the category under which the Data Stream is to be added. Feel free to load a suitable icon. If you do not, the default icon will be used. Sample icons can be found in the Icon Library. Select a collection that will be used to publish Data Stream. Enter a description to best describe the Data Stream. Click on \"Save\". In a production environment, Data Streams would integrate with external data emitters through Agents like OSIsoft PI or MQTT Listeners. However, for the sake of keeping the example simple, we won't be using any Agents that require an environment to be set up. Instead, we will be simulating the data with the Event Simulator, Calculated Field, and CSV Context Provider Agents. To simulate the telemetry from the pumps, follow the steps below: Drag into the canvas one of each of the following Agents: Event Simulator (Listener) Calculated Field (Transformation) CSV (Context Provider) Join (Transformation) Note Refer to How to Upload an Agent to Data Stream Designer if you are not able to find the Agents in the toolbox or the correct versions. You can search for the Agent in the search bar, and click and drag the Agent into the canvas to add it. An instance of an Agent added to the canvas is referred to as a Stream Object. Once you have all four Stream Objects in the Data Stream canvas, rename them as follows: Event Simulator as \"Simulate Pump Data\" Calculated Field as \"Add Pump Identifier\" CSV as \"Simulate Context Data for Assets\" Join as \"Contextualize Data\" To change the name of a Stream Object, click the text and edit it. Your stream should end up looking like this: Once you have renamed all four Stream Objects, connect them with arrows as follows: \"Simulate Pump Data\" to \"Add Pump Identifier\" \"Add Pump Identifier\" to \"Contextualize Data\" (first input) \"Simulate Context Data for Assets\" to \"Contextualize Data\" (second input) To connect two Stream Objects, click and drag the green rectangle (Output) at the bottom edge of the first Stream Object, move the cursor to the green rectangle on the left edge of the second Stream Object (Input). Your connected Stream Objects should look like this: Now we will configure the added Stream Objects. Save your Data Stream now and after every change to propagate the changes throughout the Data Stream. Note See the article on how to configure Stream Objects for more information. Simulate Pump Data We will need to simulate ingesting data about flow rate and temperature from sensors in the pumps. We can achieve this with the Event Simulator Agent. The \"Simulate Pump Data\" Event Simulator will constantly generate data defined by the Event Definitions at a rate defined by the Events per Second property. Note To edit the configuration of a Stream Object, either double-click it or click it once to select it and click the \"Configure\" button on the canvas header. Edit the \"Simulate Pump Data\" Stream Object and click the + button to the right of the Event Definition grid to add event definitions. Add two event definitions as follows: Name: WaterTemperature Type: Range Minimum Value: 100 Maximum Value: 160 Spike Value: 0 Name: FlowRate Type: Range Minimum Value: 14000 Maximum Value: 16000 Spike Value: 0 Ignore the Spike Value and Generate Spike options, as they are not relevant to the current scenario. Change the Events per Second to 1. Click \"Apply\" on the Simulate Pump Data configuration page. Then click \"Save\" on the Data Stream page. Add Pump Identifier We need to add a way to simulate having three different pumps. At the moment the data is not identified, so we will need to add a range of identifiers to the data. This can be achieved with the Calculated Field Agent. The \"Add Pump Identifier\" Calculated Field will add a \"PumpId\" field to the data generated with values \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\" for each subsequent row. To configure the Stream Object, double click on \"Add Pump Identifier\" to open its configuration. Or, you can also highlight the Stream Object and click on the \"Configure\" option at the top of the Data Stream. Keep \"Append to Current\" as the \"Results Returned As\" value. This will add the value calculated by the expression to each row instead of creating a new row with the identifier. Click the + button to the right of the Expressions grid to add the following expression: Calculated Field: \"PumpId\" - The field won't exist yet in the dropdown, so you must enter it yourself. Expression: ReadingNo % 2 == 0 ? \"A\" : ReadingNo % 3 == 0 ? \"B\" : \"C\" Data Type: String Press \"Apply\" on the PumpId expression and the Add Pump Identifier configuration pages, and press \"Save\" on the Data Stream page. Simulate Context Data for Assets There is often metadata associated with assets that is not part of the live data from the sensors. In this case, metadata includes whether the pump is currently under maintenance, the manufacturer, and the last service date. We must retrieve this data from elsewhere. In a production environment, this might be an SAP EAM system, but for this example, we can achieve this through the CSV Context Provider Agent. Double-click on the \"Simulate Context Data for Assets\" Stream Object to open the configuration menu. You can also highlight the Stream Object and click on the \"Configure\" option at the top of the Data Stream. Download the provided file. The contents of the file are below the download link. AssetsContext.csv PumpId,UnderMaintenance,Manufacturer,ServiceDate A,FALSE,Bosch,2020-10-12 B,FALSE,Bosch,2020-08-06 C,FALSE,Bosch,2020-01-04 Then under Data check the Use Uploaded File? checkbox and upload the file into the CSV Context Provider. The CSV Definition will be automatically detected and filled. Change UnderMaintenance from a String to a Boolean, using the options from the dropdown. Also change ServiceDate from a String to a DateTime, using the dropdown. Leave the Limit Rows, Filter Criteria, and Sort by properties as their default values. When completed, press the \"Apply\" button at the top of the configuration, and then save the Data Stream. Contextualize Data The metadata about each pump needs to be appended to each row of sensor data received from the pumps. This can be achieved with the Join Agent. The \"Contextualize Data\" Join will join together the data from the CSV Context Provider and the Calculated Field using the PumpId as the common field. Configure it as follows: Behavior: Context - we want to join some context data to our row. Context Endpoint: Right - we must tell the Stream Object which input has Context data. The Context Data is received by the Right endpoint, as shown in the image below. Select List: all fields except R_PumpId (as the same data will be in L_PumpId). Join Type: Inner Join. On: L_PumpId = R_PumpId Note You may need to maximize the page to see the grid properly. You can do this by pressing the \"Maximize\" button in the top-right corner of the page. Press the \"Restore\" button in the top-right corner to return it to the regular size. Press \"Apply\" on the Contextualize Data configuration page, and press \"Save\" on the Data Stream page. Create Analytics and Calculations In this section, we will add some analytics and calculations that will find exceptions, transform the units of the data and find the average level across 5 seconds. Ignore Pumps Under Maintenance We want to only pass data onward in the Stream if the current pump is not under maintenance. This can be achieved with the Filter Agent. To do this, drag in a Filter Agent and connect the \"Contextualize Data\" Join endpoint to the Filter. Rename the Filter to \"Ignore Pumps Under Maintenance\", and save. Double-click on the Stream Object to open the configuration menu. Click on the + symbol to add a new rule for the filter. Select \"Add Condition\", and configure the Filter to have the logic R_UnderMaintenance Equals false. The configuration and Data Stream should look like this: There are two green outputs to the Filter Stream Object, the left output is where the data is output to when the filter is true. The right output is where the data is output to when the filter is false. The left True Output should be the output that you connect to the next Stream Object. Press \"Apply\" on the Ignore Pumps Under Maintenance Data configuration page, and press \"Save\" on the Data Stream page. Change Unit to L/s The data from the Pump Data has different units than what we want to use - it is measured in L/m and we want the units to be in L/s. This can be solved with the Calculated Field Agent. To transform the data, drag in a Calculated Field Agent, and rename it to \"Change Unit to L/s\". Connect the \"Ignore Pumps Under maintenance\" Filter endpoint to the Calculated Field and Save. Make sure you connect the left True Output of the \"Ignore Pumps Under maintenance\" Stream Object to the Calculated Field's input. Configure the Calculated Field as follows: Calculated Field: L_FlowRate Expression: L_FlowRate / 60 Data Type: Double This will divide the flow rate by 60 to make the value in L/s instead of L/m. Press \"Apply\" on the Change Unit to L/S configuration page, and press \"Save\" on the Data Stream page. Average across 5 seconds The Use Case requires that engineers should be alerted if the flow rate averaged over 5 seconds falls below 250 L/s, and if the temperature averaged over 5 seconds also starts to rise above 130°C then a critical level alert should be raised. This can be achieved with the Aggregate Agent. To calculate the average temperature and flow rate over 5 seconds, drag in the Aggregate Agent and name it \"Average across 5 seconds\". Connect the \"Change Unit to L/S\" Calculated Field endpoint to the Aggregate Agent and save. Note You may need to maximize the page to see the grid properly. You can do this by pressing the \"Maximize\" button in the top-right corner of the page. Press the \"Restore\" button in the top-right corner to return it to the regular size. Configure the Aggregate Agent as follows: Attributes to group on: L_PumpId Aggregate: Average (of) L_FlowRate (as) FlowRateAvg Average (of) L_WaterTemperature (as) CoolantTemperatureAvg Unit: Second Size: 5 Press \"Apply\" on the Average across 5 seconds configuration page, and press \"Save\" on the Data Stream page. Data Conversion We want the data for the average flow rate to be in integer format to display it more easily. This can be achieved through the Data Conversion Agent. To do this, drag in a Data Conversion Agent and rename it to \"Data Conversion\". Connect the \"Average across 5 seconds\" endpoint to the Data Conversion Agent and press \"Save\" on the Data Stream page. Configure the Data Conversion Agent with the following two rows (You may need to maximize the page again). Click on the + symbol to add each row: First row: Input Column: \"FlowRateAvg\" Output Alias: \"FlowRateAvg\" Data Type: \"Int64\" Second row: Input Column: \"CoolantTemperatureAvg\" Output Alias: \"CoolantTemperatureAvg\" Data Type: \"Int64\" The input columns should already have FlowRateAvg and CoolantTemperatureAvg as options listed in the dropdown menu. This will replace the FlowRateAvg and CoolantTemperatureAvg with values converted to Integer format. Press \"Apply\" on the Data Conversion configuration page, and press \"Save\" on the Data Stream page. Output Formatting and Action Integrations In this section, we will integrate our Data Stream with the App Designer to trigger Recommendations and send data to Apps. Run Recommendation First, we want to trigger Recommendations with the data from the Data Stream. This can be achieved with the Run Recommendation Agent. To do this, drag in a Run Recommendation Agent and rename it to \"Run Recommendation\". Connect the \"Data Conversion\" endpoint to the Run Recommendation Agent and press \"Save\" on the Data Stream page Configure the Run Recommendation Stream Object as follows: Url: the URL of the App Designer site Key: the App Designer Key. Output on first occurrence Only?: true Entity Identifier: L_PumpId - this is for the Recommendation to create separate Alerts for each Entity Columns To Return: Leave empty (Return all columns) Note It is highly recommended that you use any variables that you already have that store the URL or key. You may use the variables that have already been set up if you are using the Free Trial. Otherwise, the App Designer URL and Key can be found by following these steps: Open the App Designer in a new tab by clicking the \"Waffle\" button (a.ka. \"App Launcher\") in the top left corner of the page and clicking \"App Designer\". Copy the App Designer URL from the browser's address bar and paste it into the Url field in the Run Recommendation configuration. Click the \"Settings\" button in the top bar and click the \"Copy\" button to the right of the Integration Key and paste it in the Key field in the Run Recommendation configuration. You will only be able to see this if you have Admin access. If you do not have Admin access, you can ask an Admin to share the key with you. Note If you are configuring the URL and Integration Key without using variables, make sure you uncheck the \"Use Connection Variables\" checkbox option first. This is how your Data Stream and configuration should look: Press \"Apply\" on the Run Recommendation configuration page, and press \"Save\" on the Data Stream page. XMPro App We want to send data to an App to be displayed as a decision support dashboard for the engineers. This can be achieved through the XMPro App Agent. Drag two XMPro App Agents onto the Data Stream and name them \"Post Pump Overview\" and \"Post Pump Specifics\". One will send an overview of the data for all pumps, and the other will send a large cached amount of data for each pump. Now we run into a problem; we want to connect multiple agents to the same data. To solve this, drag a Broadcast Agent into the Stream, and rename it to \"Broadcast\". Disconnect the \"Ignore Pumps Under Maintenance\" input arrow and connect it to the new Broadcast Stream Object. You can disconnect the arrow by highlighting the arrow itself and clicking on the \"Delete\" button at the top of the Data Stream. Alternatively, you can click on the green rectangle (input) on the \"Ignore Pumps Under Maintenance\" Stream Object, and drag the arrow to the green rectangle (input) of the \"Broadcast\" Stream Object. Connect the Broadcast endpoints to the two XMPro App Stream Objects and the \"Ignore Pumps Under maintenance\" Filter, as shown in the video below: Press the \"Save\" button at the top of the Data Stream. Your Data Stream should now look like this: Configure the \"Post Pump Overview\" Stream Object to store in cache and output only one row per pump as follows: (Follow the steps given for the Run Recommendation Agent above to get the Url and Key.) Url: the URL of the App Designer site Key: the App Designer Key. Cache Size: 1 Replace Cache: false Cache Per Entity: true Entity Identifier: L_PumpId Primary Key: L_PumpId Note It is highly recommended that you use any variables that you already have that store the URL or key. You may use the variables that have already been set up if you are using the Free Trial. Note If you are configuring the URL and Integration Key without using variables, make sure you uncheck the \"Use Connection Variables\" checkbox option first. Press \"Apply\" on the Post Pump Overview configuration page and press \"Save\" on the Data Stream page. Configure the \"Post Pump Specifics\" Stream Object to cache and output 20 rows per pump as follows: Url: the URL of the App Designer site Key: the App Designer Key. For more detail on how to find the key in the Site Settings, see this article. Cache Size: 20 Replace Cache: false Cache Per Entity: true Entity Identifier: L_PumpId Primary Key: L_PumpId and L_ReadingNo Note It is highly recommended that you use any variables that you already have that store the URL or key. You may use the variables that have already been set up if you are using the Free Trial. Note If you are configuring the URL and Integration Key without using variables, make sure you uncheck the \"Use Connection Variables\" checkbox option first. Press \"Apply\" on the Post Pump Specifics configuration page and press \"Save\" on the Data Stream page. Your Data Stream is now complete. To start the stream, click on the \"Publish\" button. To see the data flow at each Stream Object, press the \"Live View\" button and select all the Stream Objects. Alternatively, you can also select specific Stream Objects. For example, if you just want to see the data flowing through to the XMPro App, select the XMPro App Stream Object. Troubleshooting the Data Stream To see if data is flowing properly within the Data Stream, you will need to Publish the Data Stream. Before publishing, you want to make sure there are no errors in the configurations of the Stream Objects. Click on the \"Integrity Check\" option at the top of the Data Stream. If any errors are present, the Stream Object with the errors will turn red. Hovering over the Stream Object will show you the list of errors. Once these errors are fixed, you will need to run the Integrity Check again. Note To read more about Integrity Checks, read the Verifying Stream Integrity article. Once all Stream Objects have passed the Integrity Check, you can click on \"Publish\", then \"Live View\", on the top of the Data Stream. The Live Data will open on the side, and you can then click on \"Select Views\" to click on the Stream Objects you want to troubleshoot. If data is displaying for the Stream Object, that means the Stream Object should be working correctly. If not, you can recheck your configuration values for the Stream Object. You can also check if you have a Stream Host running. There are also other ways that you can troubleshoot Data Streams. Note For more ways on how you can troubleshoot a Data Stream, read the Troubleshoot a Data Stream article. 2. Create Event Rules & Recommendations The Use Case requires that engineers should be alerted if the flow rate averaged over 5 seconds falls below 250 L/s, furthermore, if the temperature averaged over 5 seconds also starts to rise above 130°C then a critical level alert should be raised. To achieve this we will use Recommendations. Recommendations can be found in the App Designer. Open the App Designer in a new tab by clicking the button in the top left corner of the page and clicking \"App Designer\". To access the Recommendation management section of the App Designer, click on the \"Recommendations\" button in the left menu and press the \"Manage Recommendations\" button on the page. Create Event Rule and Rule Logic To trigger the required Alerts, we will be creating a Recommendation with two Rules. First, create a Recommendation called \"Pump Flow Threshold\". The Data Stream should be the same \"Pump Condition Monitoring\" stream we created previously. To create a new Recommendation, follow the steps below after navigating to the Recommendation management page: Click \"New\". Specify a name and category for your new Recommendation. Choose a Data Stream to receive data from. Click \"Save\". Warning Make sure to click the \"Manage Access\" command and give at least yourself Run Access, otherwise, you won't be able to see any Recommendation Alerts that will be generated by this Recommendation. This Rule will notify Engineers when the Flow Rate is lower than 250 L/s and give them instructions and resources to help resolve the issue. Select the Enable Execution Order checkbox, since we want the more critical rule to override the medium rule. Create a Rule by pressing the + button to the right of the Rules list. Give the Rule the following properties: Note The tags for the Alert Heading and Alert Description fields will not work if they are copied and pasted into the field. You will need to select the tags yourself by adding an @ symbol and selecting from the tags in the list. Name Value Description Rule Name Medium - Flow rate falling The Rule Name is for identification only and will not be shown to the user in the Recommendation Alerts grid or detailed view. Alert Headline Warning @L_PumpId: Flow rate is falling This refers to the headline that the Recommendation Alert will be created with. Any tag (starting with @) will be replaced with the value output from the Data Stream. Add tags by typing @ and selecting the item. Alert Description Flow rate is reported to be falling, danger of plant overheating and shutdown. Flow Rate: @FlowRateAvg Coolant Temperature: @CoolantTemperatureAvg This refers to the description that the Recommendation Alert will be created with. Any tag (starting with @) will be replaced with the value output from the Data Stream. Alert Ranking Medium The priority level that the Recommendation Alert will be created with. Priority level determines the order in which the Alerts will be displayed. Icon An icon of your choice (hover your mouse over the default icon to upload a different one - sample icons can be found in the Icon Library) The icon that will be displayed on the Recommendation Alert in the grid and in detailed view. Impact Metric Prefix: $ Value: 15 Unit of Measurement: K The impact that the Recommendation Alert will have. For example, if the value for this was $15K, that means that the cost of the condition causing the Alert would be $15K (or $15000). This will be shown on Alerts in the Recommendation Block in App Pages. Rule Logic FlowRateAvg Is less than or equal to 250 Data sent from the selected Data Stream is passed through the Rule Logic and if the conditions created are met by the data (and if Recurrence is set to All Occurrences or First Occurrence and no Pending Alert exists), a new Recommendation Alert will be created. You can add new conditions or groups by clicking the + button. Groups can be nested within each other to create advanced logic. In an \"And\" group, all the conditions must be true, and in an \"Or\" group, only one of the conditions must be true to trigger an alert. The Rule Logic determines whether a Recommendation Alert will be created on receiving data from the Data Stream. Note For more details on Rule Logic, see this article. Create recommendations & Triage Instructions There should be some instructions for the engineers to follow to help resolve the issue when it occurs. This can be provided through the Triage Instructions. Continue creating the Rule with the following properties: Name Value Description Enable Form false A flag that determines whether the Recommendation Alert will be created with a Form. Additional Recommendation Management Column - An additional column in the Recommendation Alerts grid. Resolution Manual Resolution determines whether new data from the Data Stream will automatically resolve the Recommendation Alert if the Rule Logic is no longer true. Manual Resolution: A user must manually resolve each recommendation. Automatic Resolution: Recommendation auto resolves when trigger conditions are no longer true. This may impact performance. Recurrence First Occurrence Recurrence determines whether new data from the Data Stream will create new Recommendation Alerts if there already exists a Pending Recommendation Alert and the Rule Logic is true. Recurrence will create an Alert for each unique Entity selected by the Data Stream. For example, since there are three pumps (A, B, and C), each pump will generate its own Alert when something goes wrong, and it will need to be resolved before new Alerts for that pump are created. First Occurrence: The current recommendation must be resolved before others can be triggered for the same rule. All Occurrences: A new recommendation will be triggered every time the rule conditions are true. Recurrence will be disabled and be considered to be First Occurrence if the Recommendation has Execution Order enabled. Log Data On First Occurrence Determines whether new events from the Data Stream that satisfy the Rule Logic, after a recommendation has been triggered, will be logged or not. First Occurrence: Current recommendation will only log the initial event which triggered the recommendation. All Occurrences: Event data will be stored for every instance that satisfies the rule logic. Enable Triage Instructions true A flag that determines whether the Recommendation Alert will be created with Triage Instructions. Triage Instructions Instructions to help whoever is resolving the Recommendation Alert. Find the Triage Instructions below to copy for this use case. Possible problems causing a discharge pressure drop: Blocked Suction Pipe A partial obstruction can be caused by a piece of foreign material being drawn across the bottom of the suction pipe during the operation of the pump. Such an obstruction may not be sufficient to stop operation completely, but will result in a reduced output from the pump. It will also cause a drop in discharge pressure and amps, and will increase the vacuum reading on the pump suction. Rough running and vibration of the pump may also occur due to cavitation within the pump. Blocked Impeller Impellers are capable of passing a certain size particle. If a particle larger in size enters the suction pipe, it may become lodged in the eye of the impeller, restricting the output of the pump. Such an obstruction will usually result in a drop of amperes and a drop in both discharge pressure and suction vacuum readings. The out-of-balance effects resulting from this condition may cause pump vibration. SHUTTING DOWN PROCEDURE Before you shut down the pump, it should be allowed to operate for a short period on only clean water to clear the system. Then proceed as follows: Depress the 'STOP PUMP' push-button on the control panel. Gland seal water (if any) must be left on during all subsequent operations, namely: start-up, running, shutdown, runback and system drain. Gland water may only then be turned off. Provide additional resources for decision support You can provide the Engineers with helpful links to videos, PDFs, or websites to help resolve the issue with the Resources. Continue creating the Rule by checking Enable Resources and adding the following Resources: Resource Url Test Procedure http://xmdocsdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/Technical/WarmanETP.pdf You can see this rule in action by clicking the \"Publish\" command in the Recommendation and in the Pump Condition Monitoring Data Stream. If the average flow rate coming from the Data Stream is lower than 250 L/s the Rule will generate an Alert for each Pump that can be viewed in the Recommendation Alerts grid. Click on the \"Recommendations\" button to go back to the Recommendation Alerts grid. To see more details about the alert, click on a row in the \"Recommendation Alerts\" grid. The Recommendation Alert page provides details of the alert and allows you to monitor, discuss, and take action. Multiple Rules and Rule escalation We want to trigger new Alerts that override the Medium level alert raised before if the temperature averaged over 5 seconds also starts to rise above 130°C. To do this we will create the second Rule and configure the escalation settings. This second Rule will notify Engineers when the Coolant Temperature is higher than 130°C and Flow Rate is lower than 250 L/s and give them instructions and resources to help resolve the issue. To create another Rule, click on the Recommendations page from the left-hand menu, and click on \"Manage Recommendations\". Select the \"Pump Flow Threshold\" Recommendation that was created previously. To make amendments to the Recommendation, you will first need to unpublish the Recommendation, by clicking on the \"Unpublish\" button at the top of the Recommendation. Finally, click on the \"plus\" symbol under \"Rules\" to add the new Rule. Create the new Rule with the following properties: Name Value Rule Name Critical - Plant is overheating Alert Headline Alert @L_PumpId: Plant has started to overheat due to low flow. Alert Description Plant is overheating due to low flow rate, immediate action is required to avoid damage. Temperature: \uFEFF@CoolantTemperatureAvg\uFEFF Flow Rate: \uFEFF@FlowRateAvg\uFEFF Alert Ranking High Icon Feel free to load a suitable icon or use the default. Sample icons can be found in the Icon Library. Impact Metric Prefix: $ Value: 25 Unit of Measurement: K Rule Logic FlowRateAvg Is less than or equal to 250 CoolantTemperatureAvg\uFEFF Is greater than 130 Enable Form false Additional Recommendation Management Column - Resolution Manual Recurrence First Occurrence Log Data On First Occurrence Enable Triage Instructions false Enable Resources false We also want the Critical Rule to override the Medium Rule. To do this, ensure that the Enable Execution Order and Auto-Escalate checkboxes are ticked in the Recommendation, and reorder the Rules to put the Critical Rule at the top. You can see the full Recommendation in action by clicking the \"Publish\" command in the Recommendation. Ensure that your Data Stream is also published and running. If the average coolant temperature is higher than 130°C and the average flow rate coming from the Data Stream is lower than 250 L/s the Rule will generate an Alert for each Pump that can be viewed in the Recommendation Alerts grid. Any pending Alerts from the Medium rule will be resolved and escalated to the new Alert. 3. Create Event Boards & Apps The Use Case requires that the Engineers should be provided a view to check the history of Pump telemetry, maintenance records, and Reservoir Level in order to enable them to take necessary action. This requirement can be met through the use of an App with a couple of Pages. Layout Event Boards First, create an Application (or App) by pressing the \"New Application\" button in the left menu and clicking the \"Blank App\" template. Give the App the following properties: Name: \"Power Plant THG Event Board\" Description: \"An App to monitor assets at a power plant.\" Category: any Icon: Feel free to load a suitable icon. If you do not, the default icon will be used. Sample icons can be found in the Icon Library. Default Theme: Dark Landing Page Layout: the first item Click on the \"Save\" button. This will take you to a page where you can view the list of pages in the App or edit the App itself. Click on the Landing Page to edit it. App Layout We will want two sections on the landing page, so follow the steps to duplicate the Vertical Stacked Layout as shown in the screenshot below. Click \"Page Layers\". Click on the carets to expand the layers until you reach the second Vertical Stacked Layout. Click on the Vertical Stacked Layout. A blue toolbar will appear at the top-right corner of the block. Press the third button with a \"Clone\" symbol to duplicate the Vertical Stacked Layout and everything it contains. Note See the article on Page Layers for more information. The result should look as below: You can rename both Vertical Stacked Layouts to identify them. In the Page Layers tab, double click the Left Vertical Stacked Layout to change the text to 'Left Vertical Stacked Layout'. Double click on the text of the other Right Vertical Stacked Layout and rename that to 'Right Vertical Stacked Layout'. The left side of the page should be twice as wide as the right side, so follow the steps to change the Left Vertical Stacked Layout's Flex Grow property in the Block Styling to 2 as shown in the screenshot below. Make sure the Left Vertical Stacked Layout is still selected in the Page Layers. Click the \"Block Styling\" button to open the style manager. Click the \"Flex Layout\" accordion item to expand it. Change the Grow field to 2. Press the \"Save\" button at the top of the Application designer. Note See the articles on How to use the Style Manager and How to use Flex for more information. The result should look like this: We want to display the properties of the pumps in regularly spaced and sized cards on an App page. To do this, create one card with a Data Source, which will repeat the card for each pump. Change the Left Vertical Stacked Layout's Display property in the Block Styling to block, so that the cards will overflow to however many pumps are present. Press the \"Save\" button at the top of the Application designer. Follow the steps below to select the left Card and delete it. We will replace the default Card with a useful layout. Open the Page Layers. Expand to the Left Vertical Stacked Layout's Card. Click the Card item to select the Card element. Click the last button on the blue toolbar to delete the Card. Replace the deleted Card by dragging in a Card from the Blocks, which will include some extra items. Note See the article on Blocks for more information. We want the card to take up half the width of the left section, and overflow to the next line when there are more than 2 cards. Select the new Card using the Page Layers tab. Click on the \"Block Styling\" tab. At the top, in the \"Style Group\" field, click on the checkbox on the left of the \"card-gutter\" tag to unselect the card-gutter style group. This is because we only want to apply styles to this specific element. Under the \"General\" subsection, change \"Display\" to \"inline-block\". Under the \"Dimensions\" subsection, change the Width to 50. Under the \"Dimensions\" subsection, change the unit to %. Rename the Metric text items to \"Status\", \"Flow Rate\", and \"Coolant Temperature\". You can double-click the text items and change the text. The Status should show an Indicator (a colored circle) to display the status of the pump. Delete the top Value. Right-align the remaining two Values by expanding the Typography section and changing the Text Align property to Right. Drag two Indicator Blocks from the Blocks tab into the deleted Value text item's box. Click the Box and change the Flex Justify to End. This will align the Indicators to the right side of the box. The \"Status\" indicator should be red or green, depending on whether the pump is under maintenance or not. Change the left Indicator's Color in the Block Properties to \"#ad6363\" (red), and the right to \"#398a33\" (green). Data Source for Pump Data Add the Data Source that will be used to display our pump data. Click on the \"Page Data\" button. Click the + button next to Data Sources. Add a Data Source with Name as Pump Data, Connection as Data Streams Connector, and Entity as Post Pump Overview. Check Live Data Updates as well to keep the data constantly updated. Click on the \"Save\" button. Click the Card and set the Data Source in the Block properties tab to Pump Data. Set Show Default Row to Never, as we don't want an empty card at the end. You can also open the Page Layers tab and look at the highlighted Block to confirm that the correct Block is selected. When the data comes in for each pump, we want the cards to display the values for each pump. To do this, we will give the values, indicators, and heading dynamic or expression values. To change a property to Expression mode, follow the steps below: Select the block (in this case the Heading of the card) through the canvas or Page Layers. Click the \"Block Properties\" button. When adding an expression for the \"PumpId\", press the button on the left of the Text property field to toggle between Static, Dynamic and Expression value modes. Change the mode to Expression so you can enter an expression to display the Pump Id that is selected. Give the Heading's Text property an expression value of \"Pump \" + {L_PumpId} by clicking the button on the left side of the field twice. Note See the Dynamic and Expression Properties section of the Block Properties article for more information. Select the Value Block next to 'Flow Rate'. Click on the \"Block Properties\" tab and give the Text an expression value of ToStr(Round({L_FlowRate})) + \" L/m\". Give the Coolant Temperature Value Text Block an expression value of ToStr(Round({L_WaterTemperature})) + \"°C\". The circle Indicators' Visible property should be changed to an expression value of {R_UnderMaintenance} and !{R_UnderMaintenance} respectively. Change the text of the Title to \"Pumps at Power Plant THG\". To launch the App to see how it looks, press the \"Save\" button at the top of the Page and then press the \"Launch\" button. Each unique pump entity will have its own card, and data will be updated constantly for the Flow Rate and Coolant Temperature. To get back to editing the App, press the \"Edit\" button at the top-right of the App. This button will only be shown for users who have been granted access to the App. Note See the How to Manage Access article for more information. Drilldown Page The Engineers want to be able to see a detailed chart and history of each pump when they click on a pump's card on the landing page. To make a new drilldown Page, close the Landing Page, and add a new Page with the + button. Name the Page \"Pump Details\". To link to the newly created Pump Details Page when clicking a card, close the page and open the Landing Page again. You can click and drag the grey header of the page to the right to see the list of pages. Click on the \"Page Layers\" tab. Expand the carets until you get to \"Box Hyperlink\", and select it. Click on the \"Block Properties\" tab. Change the Navigate to property to \"Page\", the Page property to \"Pump Details\", and click the \"Edit\" button to the right of Pass Page Parameters. Press the + button on the Pass Page Parameters page to add a new Parameter to the Pump Details Page. Name the Parameter \"PumpId\" and give it the Type \"String\". Click on \"Add\". As mentioned previously, clicking on the icon on the left of the textbox field can toggle between Static, Dynamic, and Expression modes. Click on the button in the Value column once to change it to 'Dynamic' mode, which is indicated by the Database symbol. Select the value \"L_PumpId\" as this is the value we want to pass to the drill-down page. Click \"Apply\" to apply your changes to the Pump Details page's Parameters and the Box Hyperlink. Note If you are unable to see the parameters in the drop-down list, double-check that the Data Source has been applied to the correct Card block, as shown above. To see the navigation in action, launch the Landing Page and click on one of the cards. You will be navigated to the Pump Details page. Press the \"Edit\" button at the top right of the Pump Details page to edit it. We want a similar layout for this page, so follow the steps from the Landing Page to duplicate the Vertical Stacked Layout, and make the left side twice as wide as the right side. See the instructions that previously showed how to do this. We want two cards inside the Left Vertical Stacked Layout, so select the left Card and duplicate it. We want the top left card to be twice as tall as the bottom left card, so change the top left Card's Flex Grow property to 2 in the Block Styling. Remember to uncheck the card-gutter style group to make the style only apply to the selected element. We want the title of the page to be the Pump's name, so change the Title's Text property to an expression value \"Pump \" + {Parameter.PumpId}. We also want the Headings of the page to explain what is being shown, so change the top-left heading's text to \"Details\" and the bottom-left heading's text to \"Maintenance History\". We need to get the data from the Data Stream. Go back to the Page Data tab, and next to 'Data Sources', click on the \"plus\" symbol to add another Data Source. Name the new Data Source \"Pump Live Data\", with the Connection \"Data Streams Connector\", Entity as \"Post Pump Specifics\", and Live Data Updates checked. Drag a Chart into the Details card. Highlight the Chart, and in the Block Properties tab, set the Data Source of the Chart to \"Pump Live Data\". Add a Filter to the Data Source of L_PumpId Equals {Parameter.PumpId}. Click on the \"plus\" button to start adding the filter. When selecting the \"PumpId\", press the button on the left of the field to toggle between Static and Dynamic value modes. Change the mode to Dynamic so you can select a dynamic value from the dropdown. Here you can select the \"PumpId\" Parameter. This will make sure the chart is only showing data from the pump that we are looking at. Note See the Chart article for more information. We want the chart to look great and display a line series in a separate panel for flow rate and temperature. To do this, edit the Block Properties of the Chart as follows: In the Appearance accordion item set the Legend Alignment to \"Align Bottom Center\". In the Axes accordion item, change Type to \"Date Time\", Enable Pan and Zoom to \"False\" and Display Grid Lines to \"False\". In the Data accordion item, add two series with the + button to the right of the Series list as follows (leave the default value if it is not specified): Property Flow Rate Series Temperature Series Name Flow Rate Temperature Color #7ee2b5 #c46565 Type Line Line Pane Default Temperature X Axis Data L_Timestamp L_Timestamp Y Axis Data L_FlowRate L_WaterTemperature When making the 'Temperature' series, you will need to add a new Pane called 'Temperature.' To add a new Pane for the chart, click the 'Edit' button next to 'Pane' in the series property page. You can see how this looks by launching the page with the PumpId parameter \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\" On this page we want to also show the Engineers the pump maintenance history. This can be achieved through the use of a grid and a SQL Data Source. Below is a script that can be used to create the table used: CREATE TABLE [dbo].[PumpMaintenance]( [Id] [bigint] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL, [PumpId] [nvarchar](10) NOT NULL, [Timestamp] [date] NOT NULL, [Comments] [nvarchar](max) NOT NULL, CONSTRAINT [PK_PumpMaintenance] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ( [Id] ASC )) INSERT INTO [dbo].[PumpMaintenance] ([PumpId], [Timestamp], [Comments]) VALUES (N'A', CAST(N'2021-05-26' AS Date), N'Routine Inspection, No issues reported.') INSERT INTO [dbo].[PumpMaintenance] ([PumpId], [Timestamp], [Comments]) VALUES (N'B', CAST(N'2021-05-25' AS Date), N'Routine Inspection, No issues reported.') INSERT INTO [dbo].[PumpMaintenance] ([PumpId], [Timestamp], [Comments]) VALUES (N'C', CAST(N'2021-05-24' AS Date), N'Routine Inspection, No issues reported.') INSERT INTO [dbo].[PumpMaintenance] ([PumpId], [Timestamp], [Comments]) VALUES (N'A', CAST(N'2021-03-15' AS Date), N'High Vibration detected, main shaft replaced.') INSERT INTO [dbo].[PumpMaintenance] ([PumpId], [Timestamp], [Comments]) VALUES (N'B', CAST(N'2021-03-14' AS Date), N'Routine Inspection, bearing replaced.') INSERT INTO [dbo].[PumpMaintenance] ([PumpId], [Timestamp], [Comments]) VALUES (N'C', CAST(N'2021-03-13' AS Date), N'Routine Inspection, bearing replaced.') INSERT INTO [dbo].[PumpMaintenance] ([PumpId], [Timestamp], [Comments]) VALUES (N'A', CAST(N'2021-01-04' AS Date), N'Routine Inspection, No issues reported.') INSERT INTO [dbo].[PumpMaintenance] ([PumpId], [Timestamp], [Comments]) VALUES (N'A', CAST(N'2020-07-25' AS Date), N'Routine Inspection, bearing replaced.') Drag a Data Grid into the Maintenance History card and edit its Block Properties. Press the + button next to the Data Source select box to add a new Data Source, and name it \"Pump Maintenance.\" We want to add a SQL Data Source, but we don't have a SQL Connection yet. Press the + button next to the Connection select box and click on \"SQL Connector.\" Give the new SQL Connector a Name, enter your own connection string, User Name, and Password, and choose a Database. If you are using the Free Trial, you can get these details in your welcome email. XMPro sets up a 2GB database for you to use during the 120-day trial period. Save the Connection and select it in the New Data Source. Select the \"PumpMaintenance\" table and give the Data Source the name \"Pump Maintenance\". Save the new Data Source and select it in the Data Grid's Block Properties. This grid will show all the Pump Maintenance rows, but we want to show just the rows that this page is looking at. To do that, edit the Filter and add the filter logic: PumpId Equals {Parameter.PumpId} We want to change the Data Grid's columns around to make them look good. Open the Columns accordion item, and reorder the columns by dragging the dotted handles to the left of the list. Order them Id, Comments, Timestamp, PumpId. We don't want to show the PumpId, as it will always be the same. To hide it, click the \"PumpId\" row in the list and change the Visible property to \"False\". Apply the changes to the column. The Timestamp column should be in Date format, not Date Time. Edit the Timestamp column and change Type to \"Date\". Launch the page with the PumpId parameter \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\" to see this in action. It should look like this: Easy Access to Recommendations We want engineers to be able to see and respond to Recommendation Alerts from this App, so we should drag a Recommendations Block into the right card of both Pages. Also, rename the heading to \"Recommendations\". To filter the Recommendation Alerts to the relevant ones only, select the \"Pump Flow Threshold\" in the Block Properties of the Recommendations Block on both pages. On the Pump Details Page, we only want to show the Recommendation Alerts for the specific pump we're looking at. To do this, Change the Entity ID property to Equals Parameter.PumpId. We have now completed the requirements of the Use Case. To see the App running live, click on the \"Launch\" button. You can also publish the App by dragging the canvas to the left to open the page list, and clicking on \"Publish\". Here is how the final drill-down page looks:"

    "title": "Building Agents | XMPro",
    "summary": "Building Agents Overview To get started with developing a new Agent, create a new C# library project in Visual Studio and import the XMPro.IoT.Framework NuGet package. When writing the code for an Agent, you will have to implement a number of interfaces. Which interfaces to implement depends on the category under which your Agent will fall: Listeners Listeners are created by implementing IAgent and IPollingAgent interfaces. To push the events to the next receiver, the OnPublish event should be invoked and the events should be passed as arguments. Action Agents/ Functions Action Agents are created by implementing the IAgent and IReceivingAgent interfaces. The Receive method will be called every time events are received by this Agent. To publish these events again, the same logic as per the Listener Agent can be used. Context Providers Context Providers are created by implementing the IAgent, IPollingAgent interfaces. They are very similar to Listeners; however, Context Providers publish all available records/events when polled instead of only publishing the newer/changed ones. Transformations Transformations are implemented in a similar way as Action Agents, except that all Transformations should have the Require Input Map flag set to false and must not implement the GetInputAttributes method, hence it should be: public IEnumerable<XMIoT.Framework.Attribute> GetIntputAttributes(string endpoint, IDictionary<string, string> parameters) { throw new NotImplementedException(); } The interfaces that can be implemented are as follows: IAgent IPollingAgent IReceivingAgent IPublishesError IAgentLogger (v4.4.19) The matrix below shows which interface needs to be implemented for which category Agent: Agent Category IAgent IPollingAgent IReceivingAgent IPublishesError IAgentLogger Listener Required Recommended Optional Optional Optional Context Provider Required Recommended Optional Optional Optional Transformation Required Optional Required Optional Optional Action Agent/ Function Required Optional Required Optional Optional AI & Machine Learning / Gen AI Required Optional Required Optional Optional Note The IPollingAgent interface is not strictly required for Listeners or Context Providers, however, it is generally used in most cases. Not implementing IPollingAgent for a Listener or Context Provider should be considered an advanced option. IAgent IAgent is the primary interface that must be implemented by all Agents as it provides the structure for the workings of the Agent. After implementing this interface, there are several methods you have to add to your project that forms part of this predefined structure. Settings/Configurations Some Agents need to be provided with configurations by the user, for example, for a CSV listener Agent to get records from a CSV file, it needs the following: Polling interval (in seconds) CSV file CSV Definition Each of these settings should be referenced in the code and must correspond to the settings template created when packaging your Agent. Note A template is a JSON representation of all the controls and their layout that will be used to capture the settings from a user. An example of the settings template (generated using the XMPro Package Manager) is shown in the image below. The settings in this example consist of the following controls: Group (Data) File Upload Group (Payload) Grid Each control has a Key, which uniquely identifies it in the template and allows the Agent code to access its value at any time. To get the value contained in a setting, use the following code: string mySetting = parameters[\"myUniqueKey\"]; Before a template is rendered on the screen, or if a postback occurs on any control in the template, the method below would be called to allow the Agent an opportunity to make any necessary runtime changes to the template, for example, verifying user credentials, displaying all tables of a selected database in a drop-down list, etc. In this example, no changes are being made to the template but, if needed, they can be added to the todo section. Note For a postback to occur after a user navigates out of a setting field, the Postback property needs to be set to true when packaging the Agent. public string GetConfigurationTemplate(string template, IDictionary<string, string> parameters) { //parse settings JSON into Settings object var settings = Settings.Parse(template); //populate the settings/configuration controls with the user selected values new Populator(parameters).Populate(settings); // ToDo: update the controls, values or the data sources here //return the updated settings xml return settings.ToString(); } Validate If a user tries to run an Integrity Check on a Data Stream in Data Stream Designer, all Agents will be requested to validate the configurations they have been provided. An Agent has to use this opportunity to inform the user about any configurations that are incorrect, for example, credentials that have expired, required values that are missing, etc. To validate the configurations/ settings in an Agent, the Validate method needs to be implemented. This method returns an array of errors that occurred. If validation was successful, an empty array would be returned. The example code below verifies if a user has specified a broker address, topic, and payload definition for an MQTT Agent: public string[] Validate(IDictionary<string, string> parameters) { int i = 1; var errors = new List<string>(); this.config = new Configuration() { Parameters = parameters }; if (String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(this.Broker)) errors.Add($\"Error {i++}: Broker is not specified.\"); if (String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(this.Topic)) errors.Add($\"Error {i++}: Topic is not specified.\"); var grid = new Grid(); grid.Value = this.config[\"PayloadDefinition\"]; if (grid.Rows.Any() == false) errors.Add($\"Error {i++}: Payload Definition is not specified.\"); return errors.ToArray(); } Output Payload Each Agent has the responsibility to inform the Engine about the structure of the payload that will be produced by the Agent. To do this, implement the following method: IEnumerable<Attribute> GetOutputAttributes(string endpoint, IDictionary<string, string> parameters) This method returns a collection that has an Attribute type, which is a type that represents the name and type of a given attribute in the outgoing payload. As from XMPro.IOT.Framework version 3.0.2, comparison/ equality operations are also supported in Attribute, for example: new XMIoT.Framework.Attribute(\"Name1\", Types.DateTime).Equals(new XMIoT.Framework.Attribute(\"Name2\", Types.String)); Create Each Agent needs to implement a method called Create, which will be invoked when your Agent is being hosted. User-defined configuration is passed as a parameter to this method and should be stored in a class variable as far as possible for later use. This is a good point to provide any resources needed for the working of your Agent. void Create(Configuration configuration) { this.config = configuration; // ToDo: Provision any resources or write Startup logic. } Start The Start method needs to be implemented by all Agents. This method will be invoked when your Agent is hosted and starts to work. void Start() Destroy Each Agent needs to implement a Destroy method, which will be invoked if the Create method was called successfully, when a data stream is either being unpublished or it encounters an error and fails to start. Use this method to release any resources or memory that your Agent may have acquired during its creation and lifetime. void Destroy() Publishing Events To push the events to the next Agent, your Agent should invoke the OnPublish event with the events passed as arguments: this.OnPublish?.Invoke(this, new OnPublishArgs(new JArray(), \"EndpointName\")); Note Events are represented as JSON Objects and have to be pushed as a collection, i.e. JArray. Caution Please note that OnPublishArgs(Array rtr) is obsolete from XMPro.IOT.Framework 3.0.2 onwards. You are now required to specify the endpoint name on which you would like to publish (i.e. OnPublishArgs(Array rtr, string Endpoint)) Decrypting Values If an Agent's configuration contains a Secure/Password Textbox, its value will automatically be encrypted. To decrypt the value, use the following set of instructions: var request = new OnDecryptRequestArgs(value); this.OnDecryptRequestArgs?.Invoke(this, request); var decryptedVal = request.DecryptedValue; Custom Events While building your Agent, you may need to use external libraries or third-party event subscriptions to handle custom events. If these are used, you must catch any exceptions from the event handlers yourself, to prevent uncaught exceptions that could possibly crash the Data Stream if they get through. IPolling Agent The IPollingAgent interface allows time-based operations. Implementing this interface, and opting in to Polling by returning true from the RequiresPolling method, will automatically add a PollingInterval setting to the configuration template of your Agent, which can be used by the user to specify the interval for polling. The Poll method will be invoked every time the poll interval elapses. void Poll() This method will be called at regular intervals according to the Configuration settings, and can be used to perform any work or logic you wish, for example, querying a third-party system for changes. bool RequiresPolling(IDictionary<string, string> parameters) The RequiresPolling method is an advanced option. It is expected that in most cases, this method should simply return a true value, which will not change the behaviour of the Agent. The PollingInterval setting will display as normal, and the Poll method will be called at that interval, as normal. Advanced users, however, can use this method to decide to opt-out of Polling settings, by returning false. The parameters method parameter will contain the Stream Object's Configuration, allowing you to determine whether to return true to opt-in, or false to opt out, depending on what settings the user has selected. Opting out will cause the PollingInterval setting to not appear in the configuration tab, and the Poll method to never be called when the Stream is published. This may be useful when the agent you are building can be configured to either actively query its configured third-party system for data at regular intervals, or set up a persistent connection to the third-party service and passively wait for that connection to deliver data. If the Agent does not need to query for data at regular intervals, or perform other work or logic on a specific schedule, it is recommended to not implement IPollingAgent rather than always returning false from the RequiresPolling method. IReceivingAgent If your Agent is required to receive inputs from other Agents, you should implement the IReceivingAgent interface. Input Payload Each Agent is responsible to inform the Engine about the structure of the payload it consumes. To achieve this in your Agent, implement the following method: IEnumerable<Attribute> GetInputAttributes(string endpoint, IDictionary<string, string> parameters) This method returns a collection consisting of Attribute, which is a type that represents the name and type of a given attribute in the incoming payload. Input Mapping In most cases, if an incoming payload structure is supposed to be different from what the parent is sending, i.e. the Input Payload has been specified above, the user will have to map parent outputs to the current Agent's inputs. To enable this, mark the Require Input Map flag as true in the Stream Integration Manager when packaging the Agent. Endpoint Each Agent can have a number of input and output endpoints. Endpoints are the points where incoming or outgoings arrows are connected. Each endpoint consists of a Name<String> attribute. You will be passed an endpoint name when queried for an Input payload definition. Be sure to specify the endpoint name when querying the parent's output payload definition. Parent Outputs All receiving Agents can query the structure of parent Agent outputs connected at a given endpoint by invoking an event, as demonstrated in the example below: var args = new OnRequestParentOutputAttributesArgs(this.UniqueId, \"Input\"); this.OnRequestParentOutputAttributes.Invoke(this, args); var pOuts = args.ParentOutputs; Receiving Events Events published to a receiving Agent can be received by implementing the following method: void Receive(string endpointName, JArray events) The endpointName parameter will identify which endpoint the events have been received at. Note It is not guaranteed that the Start method will be invoked before the Receive method. Use the Create method to execute any logic that needs to be executed before the Receive method is called. IPublishError An Agent can publish messages to an error endpoint by implementing the IPublishesError interface. An unhandled error in an Agent will be captured and error information will be published to the error endpoint. Implement the interface member: public event EventHandler<OnErrorArgs> OnPublishError; To push the error to the next Agent, the OnPublishError event should be invoked, and the error information should be passed as arguments: this.OnPublishError?.Invoke(this, new OnErrorArgs(AgentId, Timestamp, Source, Error, DetailedError, Data)); Note Error endpoints should be enabled in XMPro Stream Integration Manager when packaging the Agent. This can be done by selecting the \"Add On Error Endpoint?\" checkbox. See the image above for an example. IAgentLogger An Agent can output logging to the the Data Stream Logs by implementing the IAgentLogger interface. Like IPublishError, this can be used for errors, but it can also be used to log information or warning messages too. The prerequisite to use this interface are XMPro.IoT.Framework v4.4.19+ and Data Stream Designer v4.4.19+. Add an empty constructor to your Agent entry point class and another constructor that accepts an IAgentLogger. See following code for the contents of the two constructors: private readonly AgentLoggerProxy _loggerProxy; public BaseAgent { _loggerProxy = new AgentLoggerProxy(); } public BaseAgent(IAgentLogger logger) { _loggerProxy = new AgentLoggerProxy(logger); } The IAgentLogger interface contains the logging methods but a proxy class is needed to execute it to avoid compatibility issues with older SH and DS. Create the AgentLoggerProxy class with the following contents: public class AgentLoggerProxy { private readonly object? _logger; private readonly Type? _loggerType; private readonly Dictionary<string, MethodInfo?> _methods; public AgentLoggerProxy(object? logger = null) { _logger = logger; _loggerType = logger?.GetType(); _methods = new Dictionary<string, MethodInfo?>(); if (logger != null) { // Cache all method infos _methods[\"LogInfo\"] = _loggerType?.GetMethod(\"LogInfo\", new[] { typeof(string), typeof(object[]) }); _methods[\"LogErrorWithException\"] = _loggerType?.GetMethod(\"LogError\", new[] { typeof(Exception), typeof(string), typeof(object[]) }); _methods[\"LogError\"] = _loggerType?.GetMethod(\"LogError\", new[] { typeof(string), typeof(object[]) }); _methods[\"LogWarning\"] = _loggerType?.GetMethod(\"LogWarning\", new[] { typeof(string), typeof(object[]) }); _methods[\"LogDebug\"] = _loggerType?.GetMethod(\"LogDebug\", new[] { typeof(string), typeof(object[]) }); } } public void LogInfo(string messageTemplate, params object[] args) { if (_logger != null && _methods[\"LogInfo\"] != null) { _methods[\"LogInfo\"]!.Invoke(_logger, new object[] { messageTemplate, args }); } } public void LogError(Exception ex, string messageTemplate, params object[] args) { if (_logger != null && _methods[\"LogErrorWithException\"] != null) { _methods[\"LogErrorWithException\"]!.Invoke(_logger, new object[] { ex, messageTemplate, args }); } } public void LogError(string messageTemplate, params object[] args) { if (_logger != null && _methods[\"LogError\"] != null) { _methods[\"LogError\"]!.Invoke(_logger, new object[] { messageTemplate, args }); } } public void LogWarning(string messageTemplate, params object[] args) { if (_logger != null && _methods[\"LogWarning\"] != null) { _methods[\"LogWarning\"]!.Invoke(_logger, new object[] { messageTemplate, args }); } } public void LogDebug(string messageTemplate, params object[] args) { if (_logger != null && _methods[\"LogDebug\"] != null) { _methods[\"LogDebug\"]!.Invoke(_logger, new object[] { messageTemplate, args }); } } public bool HasLogger => _logger != null; } Call the logging methods of the proxy class. This will now display the logs on Stream Host. protected void LogMessage(string source, string message) { if (_loggerProxy.HasLogger) { loggerProxy.LogInfo($\"[{source}] {message}\"); } } protected void LogError(Exception? ex, string message) { if (_loggerProxy.HasLogger) { _loggerProxy.LogError(ex, message); } } Example The code below is an example of a basic MQTT Listener Agent. Take note of how the interfaces and methods have been implemented. Note Please note that this example uses the M2MqttDotnetCore 1.0.7 NuGet package. using Newtonsoft.Json.Linq; using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text; using uPLibrary.Networking.M2Mqtt; using uPLibrary.Networking.M2Mqtt.Messages; using XMIoT.Framework; using XMIoT.Framework.Settings; using XMIoT.Framework.Settings.Enums;namespace XMPro.MQTTAgents { public class Listener : IAgent { private Configuration config; private MqttClient client; private string Broker => this.config[\"Broker\"]; private string Topic => this.config[\"Topic\"]; public long UniqueId { get; set; } public event EventHandler<OnPublishArgs> OnPublish; public event EventHandler<OnDecryptRequestArgs> OnDecryptRequest; public void Create(Configuration configuration) { this.config = configuration; this.client = new MqttClient(this.Broker); this.client.MqttMsgPublishReceived += Client_MqttMsgPublishReceived; } public void Start() { if (this.client.IsConnected == false) { this.client.Connect(Guid.NewGuid().ToString()); this.client.Subscribe(new string[] { this.Topic }, new byte[] { MqttMsgBase.QOS_LEVEL_EXACTLY_ONCE }); } } private void Client_MqttMsgPublishReceived(object sender, uPLibrary.Networking.M2Mqtt.Messages.MqttMsgPublishEventArgs e) { try { var message = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(e.Message); this.OnPublish?.Invoke(this, new OnPublishArgs(JArray.Parse(message), \"Output\")); } catch (Exception ex) { Console.WriteLine($\"{DateTime.UtcNow}|ERROR|XMPro.MQTTAgents.Listener|{ex.ToString()}\"); } } public void Destroy() { if (this.client?.IsConnected == true) this.client.Disconnect(); } public string GetConfigurationTemplate(string template, IDictionary<string, string> parameters) { var settings = Settings.Parse(template); new Populator(parameters).Populate(settings); return settings.ToString(); } public string[] Validate(IDictionary<string, string> parameters) { int i = 1; var errors = new List<string>(); this.config = new Configuration() { Parameters = parameters }; if (String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(this.Broker)) errors.Add($\"Error {i++}: Broker is not specified.\"); if (String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(this.Topic)) errors.Add($\"Error {i++}: Topic is not specified.\"); var grid = new Grid(); grid.Value = this.config[\"PayloadDefinition\"]; if (grid.Rows.Any() == false) errors.Add($\"Error {i++}: Payload Definition is not specified.\"); return errors.ToArray(); } public IEnumerable<XMIoT.Framework.Attribute> GetOutputAttributes(string endpoint, IDictionary<string, string> parameters) { var grid = new Grid(); grid.Value = parameters[\"PayloadDefinition\"]; foreach (var row in grid.Rows) { yield return new XMIoT.Framework.Attribute(row[\"Name\"].ToString(), (Types)Enum.Parse(typeof(Types), row[\"Type\"].ToString())); } } } } Further Reading Packaging Agents"

    "summary": "Debugging an Agent Agents can be traced and debugged once they are added and used in a Data Stream. This is particularly useful when testing if an agent is working as intended and troubleshooting agent issues along the way. Setup Before Debugging Package the agent using this guide. Make sure that the Agent is packaged as non-virtual. If the Agent is required to be virtual, temporarily set it to non-virtual during development and just repackage it to virtual when releasing. Note Only non-virtual agents could trigger all breakpoints inside the Agent's code. This will also allow you to access any local environment (database, server, etc.) that you will use for testing. Add the Packaged Agent in the Data Stream Designer by following the Adding an Agent article. Install the XMPro Stream Host by following the Install a Stream Host article. Within the installation wizard, select Console Application as the Host Type. Create a new Data Stream for testing the agent and select the collection profile you used during Installation of Stream Host. Add the created Agent in the Data Stream and Save. Run the Stream Host as Admin and Publish the Data Stream for the first time. A cache folder will be created inside the Stream Host folder which will be used later on. Steps to Debug an Agent Build the Agent Project to generate a dll. If built using the Debug configuration, the dll usually would be found inside the folder [Project folder]/bin/Debug/netstandard2.1. Replace the Agent dll on the Stream Host installation folder under Cache/[Agent Id]/[Agent Version] with the one generated. To determine an Agent's id, export a JSON from the XMP file of the agent via Package Manager and determine the value from the Id property. Run Stream Host as Admin. Run Visual Studio as Admin and open Agent solution. Add a breakpoint in the Agent's code. Attach XMPro.StreamHost.Console.exe to process. By default, Visual Studio shortcut is ctrl + alt + p. Publish the test Data Stream on the Data Stream Designer to initiate debugging. Common Issues Issue: 'Access to Path is denied' when publishing a Data Stream Make sure that Stream Host is ran in Administrator Mode Issue: Breakpoint doesn't fire Make sure the Agent is packaged as Non-Virtual. This can also be an issue with testing out multiple versions of the agent. Ensure that the agent dll is copied to the folder with the correct agent id and version. Alternatively, one can refresh the Cache folder by: Deleting the Cache folder Running Stream Host Publishing the Data Stream Copying the Agent dll to the appropriate folder Potential issue can lie in dll not containing the expected changes. Cleaning and rebuilding the agent may solve this issue. Issue: 'Sorry, something went wrong.' error when configuring an agent Make sure that stream host is running for non-virtual agents. If the agent is supposedly virtual, repackage the agent as non-virtual temporarily to be able to access your local environment settings Ensure that agent settings are configured in line with the agent's code. Things to note for: Ensure that the key when packaging agents match the key used in code (case-sensitive) Ensure that all key names are unique for both group and variables. For value fields (eg. Token Box, Dropdown), ensure that default/configured values match the expected values in code. Take note that this is also case-sensitive Alternatively, adding a breakpoint and debugging in GetConfigurationTemplate can help determine the setting/property that is causing the error Issue: 'Could not complete Integrity check. undefined' when running integrity check This can be caused by missing properties within the settings when packaging an agent. Ensure that the expected configurations within the agent's code are properly configured within the settings in package manager."

They are useful as they can be used to either retrieve data in real-time, display data, filter or sort the data, or save them to another database, depending on the function of that individual Agent. Note It is recommended that you read the article listed below to improve your understanding of Agents. Agent Creating Agents Creating an Agent can be divided into two parts: Writing the code for an Agent Agents are generally written in C# as library projects that make use of the XMPro.IoT.Framework NuGet package. XMPro.IoT.Framework requires your project to be written using a predefined structure. This structure requires you to implement certain interfaces, depending on the type of Agent you are creating. To learn more about how to use this framework, refer to these instructions. Note Code for some Agents has been made available on GitHub. It might be useful to use these resources as an example when writing your own Agents. Packaging the Agent After writing your code, you need to use the XMPro Package Manager Windows 10 desktop application to package your Agent. This application allows you to specify all the properties your Agent requires, add the user settings in the form of controls, and allows you to upload the DLL of the Agent you've written. Finally, it will create a file with a \".xmp\" extension, which you can upload to Data Stream Designer and start to use to build Streams. To package the Agent, refer to these instructions. Adding an Agent After writing a new Agent and packaging it, you can upload it to Data Stream Designer by following the steps below: Open the Agents page from the left-hand menu. Click Add. Click the Select File button and browse to the .xmp file you've packaged. If the .xmp file is valid, some of the details contained in the file, such as the name of the Agent, will automatically be listed on the form. Select the category of the Agent (prepopulated if contained in the file) Click Save. Note The Metadata field allows you to add tags for the Agent. You can either select a value from the drop-down that appears when you click in the field or type a new value and press Enter. Additional information that forms part of the Agent's details will be displayed on the form, such as the version and Metadata. The newly uploaded Agent will now be available in the toolbox on the Use Case canvas page. To add an Agent to the canvas, follow the steps below: Open the Data Streams page from the left-hand menu. Select your Data Stream. Expand the category in the toolbox where your Agent is located. Click on your Agent and drag the Agent to the canvas. Click Save. Bulk Adding Agents Uploading multiple Agents begins like a single Agent (see Adding an Agent above), except a compressed (.zip) file is selected. Note A 100 MB limit applies to the decompressed file size, not the compressed one. If the .zip file is valid, a data grid is populated with the Agent name, version, ID, category, and file size. Complete the upload by following the steps below: Select the category of the Agents (prepopulated if contained in the respective .xmp file) Click on Save If any Agents fail the initial validation due to a missing category, a status column appears to identify them. To fix this, (1) select the category and (2) click on Save. Or Discard to exit the blade. The status column will advise which Agents were uploaded successfully, and which were ignored as the version already exists. Upgrading Agents To upgrade Agents in the Data Stream, visit How To Upgrade a Stream Object Version. Deleting Agent Versions To remove one or more versions of a specific Agent, first, make sure that the versions of the Agent that you're planning to remove are not being used anymore. Then, open the Agents page from the left-hand menu and follow the steps below: On the Agents page, select the Agent. Click on \"Delete Versions\". Select the versions you would like to delete. Click Delete. Deleting Agents When planning to remove multiple Agents completely at the same time, make sure they are not being used anymore. Open the Agents page from the left-hand menu and follow the steps below: Click on \"Select\". Select all the Agents you would like to remove. Click on \"Delete\".

    "title": "Packaging Agents | XMPro",
    "summary": "Packaging Agents Getting Started The XMPro Package Manager is a Windows 11 desktop application that enables you to package a new Agent or update details for an existing Agent. See the Agent article for more information on Agents. This application takes you through the process of specifying all the properties your Agent requires, adding or changing the controls for each of the user settings, and uploading the DLL files of the Agent code. It will provide you, upon completion, with a file that can be uploaded to Data Stream Designer after which you can build Data Streams using the Agent. You can download the software from the Microsoft Windows 10 Store or by clicking here. After installing the XMPro Package Manager, launch the application from the Microsoft Store or search for \"XMPro Package Manager\" in the Start menu and then click on \"XMPro Package Manager\". Note You can run multiple instances of Package Manager at the same time. This side-by-side comparison is helpful when developing a new Agent that is similar to another; or comparing different versions of the same Agent. New / Import On the first screen of the application, you can either create a new Agent package or import and update an existing one. Note Use the arrows at the bottom of the page section to move forward or backward in the application. When you import an existing package, you have the option to export the package as a JSON file. This is useful either to compare packages or for source control and version management. You can also import the JSON file from an existing package, which is particularly useful if you need to modify translations added through the Include Multilingual Support feature. Details The Details form allows you to configure the properties of an Agent. These properties are listed and explained below. Name The name of the Agent is what the Agent will be known as once it is uploaded to the Data Stream Designer platform, for example, \"Jupyter Notebook\". Category The category is selected based on the function the Agent performs, for example, \"AI & Machine Learning\". Description The description is a brief explanation of what the Agent does, for example, \"This Action Agent allows you to create and load Jupyter Notebook files\". Version The version of the Agent. Any real number is acceptable, for example, \"1.02\". Caution If you make a change to an existing Agent, make sure you increment the version number as Data Stream Designer will not allow you to upload two of the same Agents with the same version. Virtual Agents can be classified as either Virtual or Non-Virtual. An Agent is Virtual if it is not specific to a certain environment and can be configured remotely. Non-Virtual Agents have to be in their respective environments to be able to function correctly, e.g. the SQL Server Agent, which has to connect to SQL Server via the intranet. Entry Point The entry point is the namespace and class name of the actual Agent's DLL file. For example, if an Agent with the class name \"ActionAgent\" is located in the XMPro.JupyterNotebookAgents namespace, the Entry Endpoint for it would be \"XMPro.JupyterNotebookAgents.ActionAgent\". Isolated Loading When loading Agents to use in a Stream Host, all the libraries are put in a separate Load Context. Tick Isolated Loading to keep Agent files separate and reduce the risk of libraries clashing or conflicting together. In most cases, this option should be enabled. Icon File The icon used to represent your Agent. Click the Browse button, navigate to where you've stored the file via the Explorer and select the new image file. Note It is recommended that you upload either a JPG or PNG file with a size of 64×64 pixels to accommodate for retina displays. Require Input Map Tick Require Input Map to specify that your Agent will be receiving events in a defined structure. The arrow leading to your Agent will be configurable to allow the user to map the inputs of your Agent to incoming attributes. Note If left unticked, parent outputs will be published to this Agent as they are. Add On-Error Endpoint? Tick to add an additional Output Endpoint, called an Error Endpoint. An Error Endpoint will output error information when your stream is running and something goes wrong, making debugging easier. You can also define actions that will be executed after error data is sent to the next Agent in the stream by your Agent, for example when a certain record is not valid. Endpoints The Endpoints form allows you to specify any Input or Output Endpoints. Input Endpoints These Endpoints represent entry points to the Agent, which will allow the Agent to receive data or input from another Agent. To add an Input Endpoint, type it's name in the text field and click Add. The new Endpoint will appear in the list below the Add button. You may need to hover over the list and scroll down to see it. As per the image, an Input Endpoint named \"Input\" has been added. Caution The name of the Input Endpoints has to match what has been defined in the Agent's code. To remove an existing Endpoint, scroll down in the list until you see it, select the Endpoint and click on the Remove button. Output Endpoints Output Endpoints represent exit points from an Agent and allow you to connect your Agent to another Agent, making it possible to pass data from your Agent to another Agent. To add an Output Endpoint, type it's name in the text field, change the Endpoint Type to \"Output\", and click Add. The new Endpoint will appear in the list below the Add button. You may need to hover over the list underneath the text field and scroll down before being able to see it. In the image, an Output Endpoint named \"Output\" has been added. Caution The name of the Output Endpoints should match what has been defined in the Agent's code. To remove an existing Endpoint, scroll down in the list until you see it, select the Endpoint and click on the Delete button. References The References form is where you upload the file(s) required for the Agent to execute. Only files in the Selected File(s) list will be included in the package, and any DLLs must be created in .NET. To upload a file, click the Browse button next to the DLL File(s) field and navigate to where the files are located. Select all the files needed and click the Add button to add them to the Selected File(s) list. To remove a file from the list, click the Delete button next to the file name in the Selected File(s) list. Type Description Agent The DLL file that was generated when you built the project containing your Agent source code. Reference Additional DLL file(s) referenced by the Agent File, such as Newtonsoft.Json. You do not need to upload the XMIoT.Framework.dll file as this DLL is automatically included. Resource Additional DLL file(s) needed by the Reference File. Zip The Stream Host decompresses the file, while maintaining the folder structure, so that Agents such as the Meta Agent can run external source code and self package. Settings Depending on what your Agent does, it might require that the user provide certain information, such as a server URL, username, or password. For each of these information fields (or settings), you need to specify which control should be used and what each control represents, for example, the Jupyter Notebook Agent will require the user to add a server URL. The user should provide this value using a text-box control. Thus, you need to create a control with a type of \"TextBox\" and a caption that reads \"Server URL\" in the XMPro Package Manager application. The following controls are available to be used to capture user input: Button CheckBox CheckList DropDown EditList FileUpload Filter Grid Group HTML Editor NumberBox ScriptBox TextBox Title TokenBox VariableBox Each control has several properties that have to be set and not all properties apply to all controls. For example, options apply to a drop-down control and not a text-box control. The table below contains a list of all the available properties, their description, and to which controls they are applicable. Property Name Control Type Description Allow Custom Text Drop-Down Allows the user to type custom text in the drop-down field if checked. Allow Custom Tokens Token Box Allows the user to add custom tokens if checked. Caption All Text that will be displayed with the group or setting. The caption is usually one or two words, describing the value that should be provided by the user, for example, \"Server URL\". Default Value Title The default value of the title. Font Size Script Box Size of the font in the Script Box. Group Type Groups Appears as either a sub heading (Default) or a hyperlink (SubPage) on the Agent's configuration page. Help Text All, excluding Groups If you need to provide the user with any additional information about the purpose of the setting or helpful instructions, specify it in this field. Key All Uniquely identifies the group or setting. Keywords Script Box Define your variables or other custom keywords here, so that they will be available in the editor's IntelliSense. Options (Drop Down) Drop-Down Use the Options-area to add values to the drop-down menu by specifying the Text and Value fields and then clicking Save. You may also choose an option to be used as the default option by checking the \"Set as Default Value\" box. Options (HTML Editor) HTML Editor Allows you to specify placeholders that can be mapped to input fields in the input received by the Agent. Postback All If checked, will cause the form to do a postback to retrieve values from the server when the field loses focus (when the user clicks out of the field). Required All, excluding Groups The control will be validated to make sure that a value has been specified if this box is checked. ScriptBox Height Script Box Height of Script Box. ScriptBox Mode Script Box Language in which script has to be written. ScriptBox Theme Script Box The theme of the Script Box. Themes available include: Ambiance, Chaos, Chrome, Clouds, Clouds_midnight, Cobalt, Cromson_editor, Dawn, Dreamweaver ScriptBox Width Script Box Width of Script Box. Secure All The value of the control will be treated as a secure value if this box is checked (encrypted and not displayed on the form in plain text). An example of a secure value is a SQL Server password. Show Grid Lines Grid The grid lines of the grid will be shown if checked. Show Header Grid The header of the grid will be displayed, if checked. Sort Index All This is used to determine the group or setting's position and works with increments of 10. Adjust this value to move the group or setting up or down on the form. Unique Key Grid Mark a specific column as being unique, for example, an identity column. Visible All This field sets the initial visibility of the group or setting. Adding Settings Settings are grouped logically into one or more groups, such as authentication, criteria, and output. Create a group first, then add controls for settings to the group. To do this, follow the steps below: Click on the plus-icon (top right, next to the Settings header). A form section will open, allowing you to specify a group for the settings. Specify a unique value that can be used as the key for the group. Add the caption you would like to use. Click Save. Next, we are going to add a setting. Click on the plus-icon next to the group you've created. Choose the type of control you would like to use. Add a unique key for your control. This key must correspond to what you defined in your code. Add a caption for your control. If needed, add a default value. If required, add help text. Select the options that apply from the list of check-boxes. Click Save. Output Export as JSON file Tick the checkbox Export as JSON file too? if you would like to export the file as JSON too. It will later be saved to the same directory as the XMP file with the file name category_name_version.json. Include Multilingual Support Tick the checkbox Include Multilingual Support? if you would like to add support for languages other than English. Uncheck languages you don't want to include. This feature leverages generative AI to provide language translation. It is available only if the following requirements are met: You are connected to the internet. Open AI is configured (Click here for instructions on how to do so). Note Only the Agent Description, Properties and Static Helptext are translated. Internal messages and dynamic Helptext added when building the Agent are not included. Multilingual support requires XMPro Data Stream Designer and Stream Host v4.4.16+. Override the automated translations by editing the JSON file and repackaging it with an incremented version number. Configure OpenAI Click Configure OpenAI. A form will open for you to add or modify the OpenAI Endpoint and Api Key. Click Save. Review: Details Lastly, you can navigate back through the steps to review the details that you've specified. If you are satisfied, complete the wizard by clicking the Save button below before navigating to the folder where you would like the package to be exported. Your package will be created with the file name category_name_version.xmp. Note If you imported an existing file, take care to: either click 'Save as new Agent' to generate a new Agent, or click 'Save' to generate a new version of the original Agent. ensure you select a different location folder or increment the version to avoid overwriting the original.

For example, for a SQL Connector to get records from a SQL Database, it needs the following: Server Instance User Name Password Database Each of these settings should be referenced in the code and must correspond to the settings template created when packaging your Connector. {% hint style=\"info\" %} A template is a JSON representation of all the controls and their layout that will be used to capture the settings from a user. {% endhint %} An example of the settings template (generated using the XMPro Package Manager) is shown in the image below. The settings in this example consist of the following controls: Group (Server) Textbox Checkbox Group (Database) DropDown ScriptBox Each control has a Key, which uniquely identifies it in the template and allows the Connector code to access its value at any time. To get the value contained in a setting, use the following code: string mySetting = parameters[“myUniqueKey”]; Before a template is rendered on the screen, or if a postback occurs on any control in the template, the method below would be called to allow the Connector an opportunity to make any necessary runtime changes to the template, for example, verifying user credentials, displaying all tables of a selected database in a drop-down list, etc. In this example, no changes are being made to the template, but they can be added to the todo section if needed. {% hint style=\"info\" %} For a postback to occur after a user navigates out of a setting field, the Postback property needs to be set to true when packaging the Connector. {% endhint %} public string GetConfigurationTemplate(string template, IDictionary<string, string> parameters) { //parse settings JSON into Settings object var settings = Settings.Parse(template); //populate the settings/configuration controls with the user selected values new Populator(parameters).Populate(settings); // ToDo: update the controls, values or the data sources here //return the updated settings xml return settings.ToString(); } Entities Each Connector must inform the Engine about the Entities that will be produced by the Connector. To do this, implement the following method: public IEnumerable<Entity> GetEntities(IDictionary<string, string> parameters) This method returns a collection of Entities, which represent an object or a function of the Connector. For example, an Entity can be a Table within the configured Database in the SQL Connector. Each Entity contains the following: Name Description EntityId A unique identifier for the Entity. Name The name of the entity. IsLive Indicate if the Entity supports Live Updates. Operations The operations which the Entity supports. Read Insert Update Delete {% code overflow=\"wrap\" %} new Entity(\"OpenRecommendation\") { IsLive = True, Name = \"Open Recommendation\", Operations = Operation.Read }; {% endcode %} Entity Properties The Connector must provide a list of the Entity's properties, which describe its key, output schema, and optional inputs. To achieve this, implement the following method: public Entity GetEntity(string entityId, IDictionary<string, string> parameters) This method returns the Entity with a collection of properties for the selected Entity's entityId, which is passed as a parameter to this method. Most properties will be Output properties, which describe the Entity's data, and are indicated by setting key and isParameter to false. For example, this String property named OutputString: {% code overflow=\"wrap\" %} new Property(\"OutputString\", Settings.Enums.Types.String, key: false, isParameter: false) {% endcode %} At least one property should be marked as the Entity's Key, indicated by setting key to true. The key uniquely identifies records when performing Update or Delete tasks, and for Application Blocks such as Grids that require a unique key per record. For example, this Long property named Id: new Property(\"Id\", Settings.Enums.Types.String, key: true, isParameter: false) Finally, we have the optional Parameter properties, indicated by setting isParameter to true. They are included in the output schema, but also exposed to the App Page as optional input to the Read operation - retrieved from its options parameter to modify the results. For example, this Int property named Input: new Property(\"Input\", Settings.Enums.Types.Int, key: false, isParameter: true); {% hint style=\"info\" %} Few Connectors need Parameter properties - they are used when the desired outcome is not achievable through the regular Configuration settings or the data source filter. For example, the Azure Digital Twins Connector's Time Series entity includes an optional input parameter, \"$ts\", which shows up in the output as well as a Timestamp for that specific record/event. {% endhint %} Create The Connector must implement a method called Create, which is invoked when your Connector is hosted. User-defined configuration is passed as a parameter to this method and should be stored in a class variable for later use. This is a good point to provide any resources needed for the working of your Connector. void Create(Configuration configuration) { this.config = configuration; // ToDo: Provision any resources or write Startup logic. } Read The Read method is one of the Entities' operations and is expected to return a JToken back to the Engine. This method is invoked when a Read/Refresh Action is called from a Block within an App Page. {% code overflow=\"wrap\" %} public IQueryable<JToken> Read(string entityId, OperationOptions options, out long count, JObject extraOptions = null) {% endcode %} This method contains a list of parameters being passed from the Engine. Name Description entityId A unique identifier for the Entity OperationOptions The operation options as configured by a user: Parameters: a JObject containing the input parameters' value Filter: the data filter criteria TransactionName: the name of the transaction count The number of records extraOptions A JObject contains the following: Sort: the data sorting criteria Skip: the number of records to skip Take: the number of records to return Insert The Insert method is one of the Entities' operations and is expected to return a JObject back to the Engine with the inserted record Id. This method will be invoked when an Insert Action is called from a Block within an App Page. public JObject Insert(string entityId, JObject values, OperationOptions options) Name Description entityId A unique identifier for the Entity values A JObject of values to be inserted OperationOptions The operation options as configured by a user: Parameters: a JObject containing the input parameters' value Filter: the data filter criteria TransactionName: the name of the transaction Update The Update method is one of the Entities' operations and is expected to return a JObject back to the Engine with the updated record Id. This method will be invoked when an Update Action is called from a Block within an App Page. {% code overflow=\"wrap\" %} public JObject Update(string entityName, JObject key, JObject values, OperationOptions options) {% endcode %} Name Description entityId A unique identifier for the Entity key A JObject containing the primary key of the record to be updated values A JObject of values to be updated OperationOptions The operation options as configured by a user: Parameter: a JObject containing the input parameters' value Filter: the data filter criteria. TransactionName: the name of the transaction Delete The Delete method is one of the Entities' operations and is expected to return back to the Engine with the number of records deleted. This method will be invoked when a Delete Action is called from a Block within an App Page. public int Delete(string entityId, JObject key, OperationOptions options) Name Description entityId A unique identifier for the Entity key A JObject containing the primary key of the record to be deleted OperationOptions The operation options as configured by a user: Parameters: a JObject containing the input parameters' value Filter: the data filter criteria TransactionName: the name of the transaction Destroy Each Connector must implement a Destroy method, which will be invoked when an App Page is closed. Use this method to release any resources or memory that your Connector may have acquired during its lifetime. void Destroy() Decrypting Values If a Connector’s configuration contains a Secure/Password Textbox, its value will automatically be encrypted. To decrypt the value, use the following set of instructions: var request = new OnDecryptRequestArgs(value); this.OnDecryptRequestArgs?.Invoke(this, request); var decryptedVal = request.DecryptedValue; Custom Events While building your Connector, you may need to use external libraries or third-party event subscriptions to handle custom events. If these are used, you must catch any exceptions from the event handlers yourself, to prevent uncaught exceptions that could possibly crash the App Page if they get through. ILiveConnector The ILiveConnector interface allows the Connector to send notifications to an App Page to notify of a change to the entity. There are several methods required to implement this interface. Subscribe Subscribe is called by the Engine to inform the Connector that an App Page has been opened that uses Live Data from a given Entity (IsLive property set to true), and should be used to begin listening for changes to that entity. The Subscribe method has two overloads and can be used in the following ways: Use the first overload if you only want to pass the entity ID to the method. public void Subscribe(string entityId) Use the second overload if you want to use filtering. public void Subscribe(string entityId, OperationOptions options, JObject extraOptions) {% hint style=\"warning\" %} The second overload is supported on App Designer v4.3.5 and XMPro.Integration.Framework v4.2 and above. {% endhint %} UnSubscribe Unsubscribe is called by the Engine to inform the Connector that all AppPages that use Live Data from a given Entity have been closed, and should be used to stop listening for changes to that entity. public void UnSubscribe(string entityId) Publish This method can be used to allow external changes to be passed to the Connector's internal entity tracking. public void Publish(string entityId, Change[] changes, JObject options) OnChange To push the changes of entities to an App Page that subscribed to the live update, your Connector should invoke the OnChange event with the values of changes as arguments: {% code overflow=\"wrap\" %} this.OnChange?.Invoke(this, new OnChangeArgs() { EntityId = entityId, Changes = changes.ToArray() }); {% endcode %} IConnectorError A Connector can publish messages to the Connector Logs by implementing the IConnectorError interface. To log the error, your Connector should invoke the OnConnectorError event with the error information passed as arguments: {% code overflow=\"wrap\" %} this.OnConnectorError?.Invoke(this, new OnErrorArgs(ConnectionId, Timestamp, Source, Error, DetailedError, Data)); {% endcode %} ITSAConnector v4.4.12: replaced the ITSCConnector interface, which is now deprecated. The ITSAConnector interface notifies the Time Series Analysis to use optimized client-side querying to increase its performance. The Connector will pre-process the large volumes of data and return it in buckets. When a Connector that implements the ITSAConnector interface is used with a Time Series Analysis Block, the Block expects the Connector to implement a specialized structure for data inputs and outputs: Implement Date Buckets by organizing the data into separate partitions based on specific time intervals, such as days, weeks, or months. Below is a of sample bucketed data with an interval of 2 hours: Bucketed Timestamp Sensor1 Sensor2 Sensor3 Original Timestamp 2024-03-28 08:00:00 25.4 18.2 32.7 2024-03-28 05:36:17 2024-03-28 08:00:00 24.8 18.5 33.2 2024-03-28 07:12:45 2024-03-28 08:00:00 25.1 18.9 34.0 2024-03-28 08:58:21 2024-03-28 10:00:00 25.6 19.2 34.5 2024-03-28 09:27:54 2024-03-28 10:00:00 26.2 19.6 34.8 2024-03-28 10:44:30 2024-03-28 10:00:00 26.5 19.8 35.1 2024-03-28 11:15:01 2024-03-28 12:00:00 27.0 20.1 35.3 2024-03-28 12:21:59 2024-03-28 12:00:00 27.3 20.5 35.7 2024-03-28 13:33:42 2024-03-28 12:00:00 27.7 20.8 36.0 2024-03-28 14:07:29 2024-03-28 14:00:00 27.9 21.2 36.3 2024-03-28 15:08:11 Replace the Original Timestamp with the Bucketed Timestamp value for final results. For example: Original Timestamp Sensor1 Sensor2 Sensor3 2024-03-28 08:00:00 25.4 18.2 32.7 2024-03-28 08:00:00 24.8 18.5 33.2 2024-03-28 08:00:00 25.1 18.9 34.0 2024-03-28 10:00:00 25.6 19.2 34.5 2024-03-28 10:00:00 26.2 19.6 34.8 2024-03-28 10:00:00 26.5 19.8 35.1 2024-03-28 12:00:00 27.0 20.1 35.3 2024-03-28 12:00:00 27.3 20.5 35.7 2024-03-28 12:00:00 27.7 20.8 36.0 2024-03-28 14:00:00 27.9 21.2 36.3 {% hint style=\"info\" %} SQL and ADX have a native function to achieve this, DATE_BUCKET() for SQL and bin() for ADX. {% endhint %} Use the interface and implement buckets on any Connector to access the Time Series Analysis Block optimizations for your Data Source.

    "summary": "Manage Connectors Connectors allow you to connect to third-party sources of data. Examples of these Data Sources include databases, Data Streams, or Recommendations, which can be integrated into the Application and are needed if you want to display any real-time or context data to the user on a Page of an Application. Note It is recommended that you read the article listed below to improve your understanding of Connectors. Connector Creating Connectors Creating a Connector can be divided into two parts: Writing the code for a Connector Connectors are generally written in C# as library projects that make use of the XMPro.Integration.Framework NuGet package. XMPro.Integration.Framework requires your project to be written using a predefined structure. This structure requires you to implement certain interfaces. To learn more about how to use this framework, refer to these instructions. Note Code for some Connectors has been made available on GitHub. It might be useful to use these resources as an example when writing your own Connectors. Packaging the Connector After writing your code, you need to use the XMPro Package Manager Windows 10 desktop application to package your Connector. This application allows you to specify all the properties your Connector requires, add the user settings in the form of controls, and allows you to upload the DLL of the Connector you’ve written. Finally, it will create a file with a “.xmp” extension, which you can upload to App Designer and start to use to build Applications. To package the Connector, refer to these instructions. Adding a Connector Connectors can be added via the Connectors page before being used in any of the Applications. Click on the Connectors page from the left-hand menu. Click on Add. Upload the xmp file of the Connector. The unique ID, name, version, and description are re-filled based on details from the file uploaded. Add the category. Click on Save. Selecting an existing Connector opens the configuration panel where details for the Connector can be viewed. The category can also be changed here. Deleting Connectors Connectors can be removed via the Connectors page. To remove Connectors: Open the Connectors page from the left-hand menu. Click Select. Select the Connectors that you would like to remove. Click Delete. 5. Confirm that you would like to delete the Connectors selected. Versions of a Connector When a new version of a Connector is added, the Connector will be updated to the new version. The old version will remain and Applications using the old version of the Connector will continue to use that version until it is upgraded manually. Open the Connectors page from the left-hand menu. Select a Connector to view its information. Each version is shown along with the number of Applications still using that version. Select the version to view the complete list of Applications still using that version. Note Users with DeleteConnector rights and Admins see the usage count for all Applications, whereas other users see the usage count of Applications to which they have access. Categories Connectors can be organized into categories. These categories are separate from the App and Data Stream Categories. Click on the Connectors page from the left-hand menu. Click on Manage Categories. The list of existing categories is shown. Click on Add. 5. Name the category. 6. Click on Add. Categories for Connectors can also be edited or removed. To edit or remove a category for Connectors, select the category from the list of existing categories to enable the edit and remove options. Finding Help for Connectors Help documentation is available for every Connector. These pages provide context, configuration definitions, an example, and release notes to help if you are unsure of anything related to the Connector you are configuring. See the Integrations article for the list of Connector documentation links."

    "title": "Packaging Connectors | XMPro",
    "summary": "Packaging Connectors Getting Started The XMPro Package Manager is a Windows 11 desktop application that enables you to package a new Connector or update details for an existing Connector. See the Connector article for more information on Connectors. This application takes you through the process of specifying all the properties your Connector requires, adding or changing the controls for each user setting, and uploading the DLL files of the Connector code. It will provide you, upon completion, with a file that can be uploaded to Application Designer after which you can use the Connector in App Pages. You can download the software from the Microsoft Windows 10 Store or clicking here. After installing the XMPro Package Manager, launch the application from the Microsoft Store or search for “XMPro Package Manager” in the Start menu and then click on “XMPro Package Manager”. New / Import On the first screen of the application, you can either create a new Connector package or import and update an existing one. Note Use the arrows at the bottom of the page section to move forward or backward in the application. When you import an existing package, you have the option to export the package as a JSON file. This is useful either to compare packages or for source control and version management. You can also import the JSON file from an existing package, which is particularly useful if you need to modify translations added through the Include Multilingual Support feature. Details The Details form allows you to specify or edit the properties of a Connector. These properties are listed and explained below. Name The name of the Connector is what the Connector will be known as once it is uploaded to the Application Designer platform, for example, “SQL Connector”. Description The description is a brief explanation of what the Connector does, for example, “This Connector allows you to read/update a SQL Database table“. Version The version of the Connector. Any real number is acceptable, for example, \"1.02\". Warning If you make a change to an existing Connector, make sure you increment the version number as Application Designer will not allow you to upload two of the same Connectors with the same version. Entry Point The entry point is the namespace and class name of the actual Connector’s DLL file. For example, if a Connector with the class name “Connector” is located in the XMPro.AzureSQLConnectors namespace, the Entry Endpoint for it would be “XMPro.AzureSQLConnectors.Connector”. Icon File The icon used to represent your Connector. Click the Browse button, navigate to where you’ve stored the file via the Explorer and select the new image file. Note It is recommended that you upload either a JPG or PNG file with a size of 64×64 pixels to accommodate for retina displays. References The References form is where you upload the file(s) required for the Connector to execute. Only files in the Selected File(s) list will be included in the package, and any DLLs must be created in .NET. To upload a file, click the Browse button next to the DLL File(s) field and navigate to where the files are located. Select all the files needed and click the Add button to add them to the Selected File(s) list. To remove a file from the list, click the Delete button next to the file name in the Selected File(s) list. Type Description Plugin The DLL file that was generated when you built the project containing your Connector source code. Reference Additional DLL file(s) referenced by the Plugin File, such as Newtonsoft.Json. You do not need to upload the XMIoT.Framework.dll file as this DLL is automatically included. Resource Additional DLL file(s) needed by the Reference File. Settings Depending on what your Connector does, it might require that the user provide certain information, such as a server URL, username, or password. For each of these information fields (or settings), you need to specify which control should be used and what each control represents, for example, the SQL Connector will require the user to add a server URL. The user should provide this value using a text-box control. Thus, you need to create a control with a type of “TextBox” and a caption that reads “Server URL” in the XMPro Package Manager application. The following controls are available to be used to capture user input: Button CheckBox CheckList DropDown EditList FileUpload Filter Grid Group HTML Editor NumberBox ScriptBox TextBox Title TokenBox VariableBox Each control has several properties that have to be set and not all properties apply to all controls. For example, options apply to a drop-down control and not a text-box control. The table below contains a list of all the available properties, their description, and to which controls they are applicable. Property Name Control Type Description Allow Custom Text Drop-Down Allows the user to type custom text in the drop-down field if checked. Allow Custom Tokens Token Box Allows the user to add custom tokens if checked. Caption All Text that will be displayed with the group or setting. The caption is usually one or two words, describing the value that should be provided by the user, for example, “Server URL”. Default Value Title The default value of the title. Font Size Script Box Size of the font in the Script Box. Help Text All, excluding Groups If you need to provide the user with any additional information about the purpose of the setting or helpful instructions, specify it in this field. Key All Uniquely identifies the group or setting. Keywords Script Box Define your variables or other custom keywords here, so that they will be available in the editor’s IntelliSense. Options (Drop Down) Drop-Down Use the Options-area to add values to the drop-down menu by specifying the Text and Value fields and then clicking Save. You may also choose an option to be used as the default option by checking the “Set as Default Value” box. Options (HTML Editor) HTML Editor Allows you to specify placeholders that can be mapped to input fields in the input received by the Agent. Postback All If checked, will cause the form to do a postback to retrieve values from the server when the field loses focus (when the user clicks out of the field). Required All, excluding Groups The control will be validated to make sure that a value has been specified if this box is checked. ScriptBox Height Script Box Height of Script Box. ScriptBox Mode Script Box Language in which script has to be written. ScriptBox Theme Script Box The theme of the Script Box. Themes available include the following: Ambiance Chaos Chrome Clouds Clouds_midnight Cobalt Cromson_editor Dawn Dreamweaver ScriptBox Width Script Box Width of Script Box. Secure All The value of the control will be treated as a secure value if this box is checked (encrypted and not displayed on the form in plain text). An example of a secure value is a SQL Server password. Show Grid Lines Grid The grid lines of the grid will be shown if checked. Show Header Grid The header of the grid will be displayed, if checked. Sort Index All This is used to determine the group or setting’s position and works with increments of 10. Adjust this value to move the group or setting up or down on the form. Unique Key Grid Mark a specific column as being unique, for example, an identity column. Visible All This field sets the initial visibility of the group or setting. Adding Settings Settings are grouped logically into one or more groups, such as authentication, criteria, and output. Create a group first, then add controls for settings to the group. To do this, follow the steps below: Click on the plus-icon (top right, next to the Settings header). A form section will open, allowing you to specify a group for the settings. Specify a unique value that can be used as the key for the group. Add the caption you would like to use. Click Save. Next, we are going to add a setting. Click on the plus-icon next to the group you’ve created. Choose the type of control you would like to use. Add a unique key for your control. Please note that this key needs to correspond to what you defined in your code. Add a caption for your control. If needed, add a default value. If required, add help text. Select the options that apply from the list of check-boxes. Click Save. Output Export as JSON file Tick the checkbox Export as JSON file too? if you would like to export the file as JSON too. It will later be saved to the same directory as the XMP file with the file name category_name_version.json. Include Multilingual Support Tick the checkbox Include Multilingual Support? if you would like to add support for languages other than English. Uncheck languages you don't want to include. This feature leverages generative AI to provide language translation. It is available only if the following requirements are met: You are connected to the internet. Open AI is configured (Click here for instructions on how to do so). Note Only the Connector Description, Properties and Static Helptext are translated. Internal messages and dynamic Helptext added when building the Connector are not included. Multilingual support requires XMPro App Designer v4.4.16+. Override the automated translations by editing the JSON file and repackaging it with an incremented version number. Configure OpenAI API Click Configure OpenAI. A form will open for you to add or modify the OpenAI Endpoint and Api Key. Click Save. Review: Details Lastly, you can navigate back through the steps to review the details that you’ve specified. If you are satisfied, complete the wizard by clicking the Save button below before navigating to the folder where you would like the package to be exported. Your package will be created with the file name category_name_version.xmp. Note If you imported an existing file, take care to: either click 'Save as new Connector' to generate a new Connector, or click 'Save' to generate a new version of the original Connector. ensure you select a different location folder or increment the version to avoid overwriting the original.

    "summary": "Manage Collections Stream Hosts are grouped into different Collections, which are created and maintained in Data Stream Designer. A Collection can be defined as a category that contains a set of Stream Hosts that run the same Data Streams. Collections are used to prevent you from having to redeploy a Data Stream to multiple Stream Hosts, devices, and assets. When a Data Stream is published for a Collection, the devices themselves can just subscribe to that Collection. Note It is recommended that you read the article listed below to improve your understanding of Collections. Collection and Stream Host Video 1: How To Use Collections Create a Collection Collections are an important concept in the Data Stream Designer. You might have to create a Collection soon after starting to use the Application as they are crucial to the workings of use cases and Streams. A Collection also has to be created before installing a Stream Host as the Stream host is dependent on the information contained in a Collection. To create a Collection, follow the steps below: Open the Collections page from the left-hand menu. Click on New. Choose a name for the new Collection. You may also include tags if needed by choosing tags from the drop-down that will open as soon as you click on the field or by typing a new value and pressing Enter. Click Ok. Change a Collection key It might be needed to replace or change the key that is associated with a Collection from time to time. To replace a key with a new one, follow the steps below: Open the Collections page from the left-hand menu. Select the Collection from the list. Click on Revoke Key.

It may be that one system is low-powered and does not have enough resources to handle the integrations or analytical tasks of the Data Stream, or some integrations may not even be accessible on a system that is outside a corporate network or behind a firewall. The solution to these problems is found by using Remote Receivers and Publishers. Two Collections are set up, and half of the Data Stream is run on one Collection while the other half runs on the other Collection. The Stream Host can automatically detect where data has to flow from one Collection to the other (a Collection Hop). Note It is recommended that you read the article listed below to improve your understanding of Live Data. Remote Receivers and Publishers How to Manage Data Streams How to Manage Collections Each Collection allows you to configure a Remote Publisher and a Remote Receiver. Every time a Collection Hop is detected the Stream Hosts will automatically set up the configured Remote Publisher, which will put the data on a central store. The receiving Collection will also automatically set up a Remote Receiver which will receive data from the store and pass it on to the Data Stream on the other side. It is also possible to set up multiple Stream Hosts to funnel data from tens or hundreds of devices into the data store, which will then be redirected to a single Stream Host with a Remote Receiver. Set Up Remote Receivers and Publishers To set up a Remote Receiver and a Remote Publisher, follow the steps below: Create two collections, one for each system. Click the Collection that will be sending data. Choose a Remote Publisher Agent and Version. Configure the Remote Publisher. Each Agent has specific configuration settings.

Toggle it off to hide the mobile app icon on the toolbar. Metablocks Added v4.4.0 Enable Metablocks Enabling this setting results in Metablocks appearing in the Blocks blade. Reports Added v4.3.7 Standard reports give the administrator a view into where (which Applications) and how (which version) Connectors have been used. The information is presented in a grid that can be sorted, filtered, reorganized, and grouped. It can also be exported as an XLSX file. Connector Usage Report This report shows all loaded Connectors, their versions, and how many times each version is used in an Application, if any. This master list shows the administrator which Connectors are installed and their utilization. This assists in identifying new Connectors or versions not yet added. Connector Usage Details Report This report shows the Applications in which a Connector version has been used. Additional information includes the Application's owner and category. This detailed report assists in gauging the impact of upgrading one or more Connector versions. Scripts Embed Script Added in v4.4.17, the supplied html script tag is inserted into every App Designer html page. Use this to load an external JavaScript script, such as to provide localized support or track user usage. For example, the below script embeds a chatbot into App Designer. // example script to embed a fastbot trained on appropriate documentation <script defer src=\"https://app.fastbots.ai/embed.js\" data-bot-id=\"abc\"></script> To improve performance and ensure users always have the latest version of your script: Use version parameters in your script URL to control caching: <script defer src=\"https://example.com/your-script.js?v=1.0.2\"></script> Note Update the version number whenever you modify the script. This ensures: Returning users get the new version immediately Users benefit from browser caching between sessions You control exactly when cache invalidation occurs Consider using content delivery networks (CDNs) for faster loading and improved caching. Use appropriate loading attributes like defer or async to optimize page rendering: defer: Script executes after HTML parsing is complete (recommended for most cases) async: Script executes as soon as it's available, potentially during HTML parsing For guidance on how to use this setting effectively, please contact your XMPro representative. Data Stream Designer Settings Security Encryption Key The encryption key is used to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data configured in the user settings of an Agent when they are stored or retrieved from the database, for example, passwords. Enable Audit Trail Enabling this setting would cause logs to be created whenever changes are made to Agents, Collections, and components of Data Streams. The records will contain details about who made the change and when it was applied. User Interface Enable InputMap Highlights Enables the Canvas arrow highlight which is shown if the arrow's configuration doesn't have mappings. This is useful for demos where the complete configuration has intentionally not been provided. Enable Stream Metrics Enables the logging and display of stream metrics (Stream Load and Stream Errors) in Data Streams. Refresh the page for the setting to be applied to the Data Stream Canvas. Behavior Default Polling Interval (seconds) Added v4.3.7 The default value that is used for the polling interval when a Polling Agent is added to a Streaming type Data Stream. If there is no value provided for this setting, the polling interval defaults to 3600 seconds (1 hour). Note The default is applied when the Agent is added to the canvas. A change to this site setting will only take effect for Agents added afterward. Live View Usage Added v4.3.6 Over time, if users did not close the Live View, these open connections placed an additional load on the Data Stream Designer (DS) as the Stream Hosts continued to send live data back to DS. This reduced overall performance and reliability, and increased infrastructure costs. We recommend that users always close the Live View of a published Data Stream before navigating away. When in doubt, an administrator can force a reset to close all open Live View connections. The Live View Usage includes the following: The number of Stream Objects (Agents) with Live View enabled and the number of Data Streams affected. A button to reset the Live View usage. Resetting the Live View will close any connections that may have been left open if a user closes the Data Stream canvas without first closing the Live View. It will also stop any open Live View blades from receiving data. To start receiving data again, re-open the Live View and reselect the Stream Objects. Refer to the Live View Usage Report for a list of Stream Objects and Data Streams that are preselected for Live View. Note A Stream Object with Live View enabled is an indicator that a user has viewed the data - it is not confirmation whether the user closed the connection. Tip The Live View issue is addressed in the v4.3.7 release: Open connections are closed regardless of how the Live View is closed (e.g. navigating away or closing the tab). All connections are closed when the Data Stream Designer app service is restarted. If you've upgraded to v4.3.7, use the Reset Live View button once to ensure all connections are closed. Reports Added v4.3.7 Standard reports give the administrator a view into where (which Data Stream) and how (which version) Agents have been used. The information is presented in a grid that can be sorted, filtered, reorganized, and grouped. It can also be exported as an XLSX file. Live View Usage Report This report shows all Agents that have Live View enabled. Additional information includes the Data Stream name, Data Stream version, Data Stream owner, the Collection name, the Stream Object name, and whether the Data Stream is published. This report along with the Reset option was useful prior to v4.3.7, to determine where connections may have been left open. Agent Usage Report This report shows all loaded Agents, their versions, their categories, and how many times a version is used in a Data Stream, if any. This master list shows the administrator which Agents are installed and their utilization. This assists in identifying new Agents or versions not yet added. Agent Usage Details Report This report shows Data Streams in which an Agent version has been used. Additional information includes the Data Stream version, its owner, the Collection, and the Stream Object name. This detailed report assists in gauging the impact of upgrading one or more Agent versions. Agent Polling Interval Report This report shows the polling intervals configured on all Agents that have the Polling Interval option. Additional information includes the Agent Name, Agent Category, Data Stream name, Data Stream version, Data Stream owner, the Collection name, the Stream Object name, and whether the Data Stream is published. This master list empowers the administrator to locate those set too short (1s) that may be causing performance issues. 10 seconds may be appropriate during initial testing, but ill-advised in a QA or Production environment. Subscription Manager Settings Security Hide Users Outside Business Role Branch When enabled, users can see the information of users in their business role and any of its parent business roles up to the root. They cannot see any child or sibling business roles and their users. For example, a user cannot tag/search users outside their business role tree path in a comment on a recommendation alert. This defaults to true on new installations. Toggle it off to make all user information visible to all users in the company. Warning The exception for this setting is a user with an Administrator role for the Subscription Manager product. They can assign access to XMPro objects to any user or business role in the company. Global Notification Added v4.4.0 Global Administrators can display a global notification across the top of all products in the XMPro suite for a specific period. This aids in communicating important information to users, such as a notice advising of planned maintenance downtime and a hyperlink to release notes. Choose a type of hint, warning, or error to set the notification icon and banner color. The banner can be dismissed for a session. Discard \"Global Notification\" Settings Clears all Global Notification settings and hides the current message, if any. Type This determines the icon and color of the notification banner. The options are a hint, warning, or error. Message A message of up to 500 characters is displayed in the notification banner. Basic text formatting, lists, and links are supported. Show Now Enabling this setting results in the notification banner being immediately shown across all products, and disables the Show On property. Show On (your local time) The date and time when the notification will be shown to users. It is stored as UTC, but displayed in the administrator's local time zone. This setting is not available when Show Now is enabled. Hide On (your local time) An optional date and time when the notification should no longer be shown to users. It is stored as UTC, but displayed in the administrator's local time zone. Leave blank if you want the message to be shown until it is manually cleared - either by clicking Discard \"Global Notifications\" Settings, clearing the Message or Show option. Support Email The email to which notifications will be sent if a user signs up to XMPro or makes a request, for instance, a request for a Subscription to a Product, or a request for a License. Disable Email Notifications Disables emails sent to the email address above for any reason. If email notifications are disabled then the Global Administrator will need to log in to Subscription Manager to check whether there are any pending requests."

How to Override Variables Although each Stream Host in a given Collection downloads the same definition of a Data Stream, the Variables defined in Data Stream Designer can be overridden by the individual Stream Host to provide the unique configuration e.g. per Asset, site, or OPC IP Address. The options to override variables for a Stream Host are: Using Environment Variables - enables the scalable and efficient creation of multiple Docker Stream Hosts through scripting. Using Variables.xv files - requires manual edits for each Stream Host. In practice you'd use one or the other, but it may be helpful that the Stream Host The Stream Host retrieves variable values in the following order: Environment Variable, if no match then... Variables.xv File, if no match then... Variables (i.e. as detailed in Using a Variable) Using Environment Variables v4.4.2 This option can be applied to any Stream Host install scenario, although it is better suited for when running Stream Host on Docker. Create an environment variable that is applied to a running Stream Host instance, prefixing the name of the variable that should be overridden with xmvariable__ xmvariable__NameOfVariable1=foo xmvariable__NameOfVariable2=bar xmvariable__NameOfVariable3=noop Using Variables.xv files Note This option is not supported when running Stream Host on Docker. Open the Collection page. Select the Collection. Hover on More. Click Variables.

    "summary": "Configure Auto Scale (Optional) Overview Data caching is a technique used to improve the performance and responsiveness of applications. It works by storing frequently accessed data in a fast and easily accessible location. When an application needs the data it can be retrieved quickly without having to go through time-consuming operations like accessing a database. Distributed caching takes the concept of caching further by caching data in an external service accessible by one or more servers. This approach offers several benefits, including increased capacity to handle larger amounts of data, synchronized data across servers, and better scalability. By distributing the cache, the overall performance of the application can be enhanced, ensuring faster response times and improved efficiency. In-memory caching: Single Server The default behavior for all XMPro installations is that this location is on the host server memory, i.e. a single server. Distributed caching: Multiple Servers Auto Scale, XMPro's implementation of distributed caching, offers a superior caching approach that is highly recommended, particularly for larger production-ready implementations. XMPro utilizes \"Redis\" (Remote Dictionary Server), which is a popular open-source data structure store for XMPro's distributed caching needs. Configure Auto Scale The upgrade path to utilize Auto Scale is as follows: Upgrade XMPro to V4.3.1+. Provision Redis. Refer to Redis documentation for a guide on how to provision Redis. Although Auto Scale has a bigger impact on App Designer performance, it is for all XMPro products that use SignalR, i.e. Data Stream Designer and Subscription Manager too. Application Designer Enable the AutoScale setting in Application Designer. Open the Application Designer appsettings.json file. In the autoscale object, set enabled to true and enter the connectionstring value. Save the file and restart the Application Designer service. { \"xmpro\": { \"autoScale\": { \"enabled\": true, \"connectionString\": \"<redis connection string>\" } } } Upgrade Data Streams Connector to V2.0+. Refer to Manage Connectors for a guide on adding a Connector and view the versions in use. Upgrade Apps to use Data Streams Connector V2.0+. Refer to Data Integration for a guide on how to upgrade an App's connection. Warning Upgrading the Connector will clear the cache from the existing connector, and all data for the consuming App will be lost. You do not have to upgrade all Apps to the new Connector version - their cached data and caching process will continue to work as before. Data Stream Designer Repeat step 1 for Data Stream Designer. Subscription Manager Repeat step 1 for Subscription Manager but in the web.config file. Note It might be encrypted, which will require you to decrypt it first.

    "title": "Configure Health Checks (Optional) | XMPro",
    "summary": "Configure Health Checks (Optional) Overview Health checks are the industry standard for the initial diagnostic step of the troubleshooting process, which provides information about the health and readiness of XMPro services. The health checks achieve this by performing periodic evaluations of connected services - each of which returns a status of healthy or unhealthy. The health checks are disabled by default. Once the health checks are turned on, you can opt to view them in the Health UI or add the endpoints to your existing business application health monitoring IT solution. Note It is also possible to include third-party endpoints - enabling you to monitor all of your health checks in a central location. Health Endpoints Each XMPro service has an endpoint that can be accessed to determine its overall health. The following health checks are performed to test different dependencies: Connection to other XMPro services Connection to the databases Connection to Redis Cache The raw JSON of the results can be accessed through the health path of the service's URL. For example, https://xmpro-ad-sample.azurewebsites.net/health Below is the description for each entry in the health check: Property Description Data Additional data provided by the health check. By default, this is empty. Description An optional explanation of the health check. Duration The amount of time that the health check took to run. Status The health check status options are: Healthy (the connection succeeds) Unhealthy (the connection fails or times out) Tags Labels that are used to group or describe the kind of health check being done. Health UI The UI provides a user-friendly display of the responses from the health endpoints. To access the health checks performed, visit the health UI of any of the services using the health-ui path. For example, https://xmpro-ad-sample.azurewebsites.net/health-ui. The health check for XMPro AI was added in v4.4.5. Configure Health Checks The following steps describe how to turn on the health check functionality. Application Designer Navigate to the IIS location where Application Designer has been installed. Open the App Designer appsettings.json file. Set enableHealthCheck in the featureFlags object to true. Note This feature flag turns on both the /health and /health-ui endpoints. Configure the URLs you want to include in the health checks within the healthChecks object. The standard endpoint for each XMPro service is /health/ping. \"healthChecks\": { \"urls\": [ { \"url\": \"<subscription manager url>/health/ping\", \"name\": \"Subscription Manager API\", \"tags\": [ \"api\" ] }, { \"url\": \"<data stream designer url>/health/ping\", \"name\": \"Data Stream Designer API\", \"tags\": [ \"api\" ] }, { \"url\": \"<xmpro ai url>/health/ping\", \"name\": \"XMPro AI API\", \"tags\": [ \"api\" ] } ] } Configure the /health endpoints you want to include in the UI within the HealthChecksUI object. \"HealthChecksUI\": { \"HealthChecks\": [ { \"name\": \"Application Designer\", \"Uri\": \"<application designer url>/health\" }, { \"name\": \"Data Stream Designer\", \"Uri\": \"<data stream designer url>/health\" }, { \"name\": \"XMPro AI\", \"Uri\": \"<xmpro ai url>/health\" } ] } Save the file. Restart the Application Designer service. Data Stream Designer Repeat the above steps for Data Stream Designer, using these values for step 4: \"healthChecks\": { \"urls\": [ { \"url\": \"<subscription manager url>/health/ping\", \"name\": \"Subscription Manager API\", \"tags\": [ \"api\" ] }, { \"url\": \"<application designer url>/health/ping\", \"name\": \"Application Designer API\", \"tags\": [ \"api\" ] }, { \"url\": \"<xmpro ai url>/health/ping\", \"name\": \"XMPro AI API\", \"tags\": [ \"api\" ] } ] } XMPro AI Repeat the above steps for XMPro AI, using these values for step 4: \"healthChecks\": { \"urls\": [ { \"url\": \"<subscription manager url>/health/ping\", \"name\": \"Subscription Manager API\", \"tags\": [ \"api\" ] }, { \"url\": \"<application designer url>/health/ping\", \"name\": \"Application Designer API\", \"tags\": [ \"api\" ] }, { \"url\": \"<data stream designer url>/health/ping\", \"name\": \"Data Stream Designer API\", \"tags\": [ \"api\" ] } ] } Adding Third-Party Endpoints Third-party endpoints are supported and can be included as part of the health check. These are added in the same place as the XMPro service health checks. Note Only endpoints that do not need additional authorization are currently supported for the health checks. Open the appsettings.json file. Add third-party endpoints to the healthChecks object. Save the file and restart the XMPro product service. Below are the properties in this configuration when including other URLs in the health check: Property Description url Determines the URL to check. name Determines the name/identifier of the health check to be performed. tags Determines the tag for the health check. This is useful for tagging/grouping health checks. timeout The amount of time to wait for a response from the site. The health check will return as Unhealthy if the timeout is reached while waiting for the URL. By default, this is empty and will wait for the URL indefinitely."

Navigate to the file location where the Stream Host has been installed. Open the appsettings.json file. Add the \"File Logging\" Serilog configuration. Save the file and restart or reopen the Stream Host. { \"FileLogging\": { \"MinimumLevel\": { \"Default\": \"Information\", \"Override\": { \"Microsoft\": \"Warning\" } }, \"WriteTo\": [ { \"Name\": \"File\", \"Args\": { \"path\": \"C:\\\\some\\\\path\\\\to\\\\logs\\\\log.txt\", \"rollingInterval\": \"Day\", \"outputTemplate\": \"{Timestamp:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} [{Level:u3}] {SourceContext} Message: {Message:lj}{NewLine}{Properties}{NewLine}{Exception}{NewLine}\" } } ] } } Using Environment Variables Note This is the preferred approach for our Stream Host Docker Images (Linux). The environment variables will take precedence over the same configuration in the appsettings.json file. Add the environment variables to the platform / service running the Stream Host. Restart the Stream Host. # Example taken from a Docker Compose file. environment: # Other environment variables - xm__filelogging__writeto__1__name=File - xm__filelogging__minimumlevel__default=Information - xm__filelogging__writeto__1__args__path=/app/logs/sh-log-.txt - xm__filelogging__writeto__1__args__rollinginterval=Day - xm__filelogging__writeto__1__args__outputtemplate=[{Timestamp:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} {Level:u3} ({TraceId}:{SpanId})]{NewLine} {Message:j}{NewLine} {Properties:j}{NewLine} {Exception}{NewLine} Other XMPro Products Repeat these steps for all the XMPro products except Subscription Manager and Stream Hosts: App Designer, Data Stream Designer, and AI XMPro. Open the appsettings.json file. Add the \"File\" Serilog configuration inside the WriteTo array. Save the file and restart the XMPro product service { \"Serilog\": { \"WriteTo\": [ { \"Name\": \"File\", \"Args\": { \"path\": \"./App_Data/Logs/log_.txt\", \"rollingInterval\": \"Day\", \"fileSizeLimitBytes\": 1048576, \"rollOnFileSizeLimit\": true, \"outputTemplate\": \"{Timestamp:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} [{Level:u3}] {Message:j}{NewLine}{Properties:j}{NewLine}{Exception}{NewLine}\" } } ] } } Note The above example provides for the following: Log files will now be added to the \"Logs\" folder located within the \"App_Data\" directory in the site's root folder. Log files are stored in the \"App_Data\" folder because it is a protected directory in IIS, preventing access via direct web links. This ensures the security of the log data. It rolls over to a new file daily, or when the file size exceeds 1MB (this helps to prevent large log files and also gives an easy way to calculate the maximum storage consumption when combined with the retention setting It retains only the last 14 log files File names will have the format log_{Date}.txt with an extra sequence number appended if it rolls over due to the size limit, for example: log_20240321.txt log_20240321_001.txt log_20240321_002.txt log_20240322.txt Application Insights This utilizes the Serilog application insights sink. See Serilog sinks file for Application Insights for a complete set of configuration options.

If your installation requires multiple Stream Hosts, please be aware that Stream Host Variable Overrides must be applied as environment variables when running as a Container - enabling frictionless automation when creating multiple Stream Host instances. Prerequisites Hardware and Software A container runtime tool capable of running Docker images, such as Docker Desktop. The XMPro Docker Stream Host image has already met the rest of the hardware requirements and software requirements. Configuration Settings The following configuration settings are required to run the Docker Stream Host. Locate these values before you proceed. Note The Keys should be set as environment variables on the running Stream Host Container. Key Description xm__xmpro__Gateway__Id A unique identifier for a Stream Host instance. A Guid Generator can be used to generate a unique identifier. xm__xmpro__Gateway__CollectionId The ID of your Collection. This can be retrieved from a Data Stream Designer \"Collection\" xm__xmpro__Gateway__Name The name that appears in Data Stream Designer when viewing Online Hosts. E.g. \"SH1-Device1-Docker\" or \"SH2-Device2-Winx64\". xm__xmpro__Gateway__Secret The secret key of your Collection.

E.g. \"https://mysampleserver/datastreamdesigner/\". Please note that this URL needs to end in a forward slash. xm__xmpro__Gateway__Rank An integer, by default is \"0\". See Stream Host Rank for further details. These settings can be found in Data Stream Designer: Repository Below is the XMPro Docker Stream Host repository. xmpro.azurecr.io/stream-host Images Image Tags All images are tagged with the release version number, starting from 4.4.2. For example, use a version tag to reference the Stream Host for v4.4.2: xmpro.azurecr.io/stream-host:4.4.2 The latest tag identifies the most recent XMPro Platform release version number, for example: xmpro.azurecr.io/stream-host:latest Warning Using the latest tag stores a copy of the image on your system. This cached version may not be the latest release if a newer release has since been published. We recommend specifying the specific version or re-pulling the image if a newer release has occurred since your last Stream Host docker install. Image Flavors A Stream Host running a Data Stream must provide the capabilities to run each Agents in the Data Stream. Choose your image depending on the capabilities that are required. Image Name Description xmpro.azurecr.io/stream-host:[tag] A lightweight Debian option capable of running most Agents. Available from v4.4.5. xmpro.azurecr.io/stream-host-alpine:[tag] A lightweight Alpine option capable of running most Agents. Available from v4.4.3. xmprocontrib.azurecr.io/sh-ubuntu-python-nvidia:latest Ubuntu, Required when using the Python Agent for CPU-only processing. xmprocontrib.azurecr.io/sh-alpine-python:latest Alpine, Required when using the Python Agent for CPU-only processing. Creating a Custom Image You may need a Stream Host that has capabilities that differ from the available image flavors such as additional Python modules (e.g. via pip). Add additional Python modules The docker image can be used to create a custom stream-host with additional Python modules installed. Use xmprocontrib.azurecr.io/sh-alpine-python:latest as the base image for python workloads. Example requirements.txt file numpy Example docker file FROM xmprocontrib.azurecr.io/sh-alpine-python:latest COPY requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt RUN pip install -r /app/requirements.txt Package Installation via Environment variables In addition to creating a custom image, the Stream Host Docker image now supports installing additional Python APKs and packages dynamically at runtime using environment variables. This allows for more flexibility without modifying the base image. You can install packages in the following ways: SHS_PIP_MODULES: Specifies Python packages to be installed via pip at container startup. Multiple packages can be listed with spaces as separators. If not specified, no additional pip modules will be installed. PIP_REQUIREMENTS_PATH: Points to the location of a requirements.txt file inside the container. This file contains a list of Python packages to be installed via pip. If not specified, the default path is /app. ADDITIONAL_INSTALLS: Lists APK or APT packages to be installed before any Python packages. These are typically system dependencies required by certain Python packages. If not specified, no additional system packages will be installed.

Both of these environments follow the above architecture and deployment. Prerequisites In order to proceed with the deployment, you are required to complete the steps in the 1. Preparation guide: Meet the hardware requirements Install the software requirements Follow the certificate and communication steps Note Two SSL Certificates are required An SSL Certificate in AWS Certificate Manager, used by IIS (See the Appendix guide).\\ An SSL Certificate, used by the SM instance (added to the S3 Bucket during the installation). Create or ask your administrator for an SSL certificate with the correct DNS name. A self-signed certificate is good enough. There are many ways to generate this certificate, one of which is described in the above 1. Preparation guide. Please note the file names must be called ssl.pfx and ssl.password.txt. Resources We are going to be deploying the following resources, please ensure you have the desired domain names ready. SQL RDS Parameter Store Elastic Beanstalk Application Elastic Beanstalk Environment – Subscription Manager Elastic Beanstalk Environment – App Designer Elastic Beanstalk Environment – Data Stream Designer & API An example of preferred domain names is as follows; each set is for a specific account as per the architecture diagram. For production: https://sm-xmpro․domain․com https://ad-xmpro․domain․com https://ds-xmpro․domain․com For non-production: https://sm-nonprod-xmpro․domain․com https://ad-nonprod-xmpro․domain․com https://ds-nonprod-xmpro․domain․com Log on to the AWS Management Console and switch to the region you want to deploy the solution in, you will need Administrative rights to the subscription to complete the deployment. Install ElastiCache In the AWS Management Console, search for ElastiCache and navigate to it Click Create (or Get Started Now if visible). Select Redis, and click Create Configure Redis Cache: Provide a name for the cache. Select the node type based on workload requirements. Configure replication and parameter groups if needed. Leave other Redis options as defaults unless specific tuning is required. Network Configuration: Provide Subnet details. Select the VPC where Redis will be deployed. Ensure security group settings allow necessary access. Finalize Creation: Click Create to deploy the Redis cache Security Group Configuration: Navigate to EC2 in AWS Services. Under Network & Security, select Security Groups. Edit the relevant security group and add inbound rule for Redis Port 6379. Retrieve Redis Endpoint Once the cache is created, locate the Redis endpoint. This will be used later in the Redis Connection String. Note Note: SignalR Compatibility: Currently, SignalR doesn’t support Redis Clusters (Microsoft Docs) Sticky Sessions must be used for SignalR (Microsoft Docs) Security Best Practices: Restrict access to Redis only to necessary sources. Consider enabling TLS encryption for secure communication. Performance Optimization: If scaling is required, consider Cluster Mode enabled for Redis (AWS Guide). Domain name DNS (Route 53/Hosting Zones) Log into Your Domain Registrar Access the DNS management section for your domain. Create a CNAME Record (For Subdomains) If you're pointing a subdomain (e.g., app.example.com), create a CNAME record. Set the CNAME value to your ALB’s DNS name (e.g., dualstack.alb\u0002name.region.elb.amazonaws.com). Create an A Record (For Root Domains, If Supported) Some registrars allow A records to point to AWS ALBs, but many do not. If supported, create an A record and set it to the IP address of your ALB (not always recommended due to dynamic IP changes). Update Nameservers (If Needed) If your registrar requires external DNS management, you may need to update nameservers to AWS or another provider. Wait for DNS Propagation Changes may take a few minutes to 24 hours to fully propagate. Considerations CNAME records work best for ALBs since AWS load balancers don’t have static IPs. If your registrar doesn’t support CNAME at the root domain, you may need a third-party DNS provider like Cloudflare or Route 53. Amazon RDS Creation In the AWS Management Console navigate to Aurora and RDS. In the navigation pane, click Databases and then click Create database. Select Standard create, SQL Server, and the desired Template for the database instance. Provide the DB instance Identifier, Username, and Password for the RDS database instance Click create. Once created, under Connectivity & Security, take note of the DB Identifier created. Note Make a note of the following: Endpoint - for example: aero-sql.cug4m2yk6h94.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com User - as specified earlier Password - as specified earlier 6. The security group will need to be modified to allow inbound traffic this is done as follows: 6.1. Click the VPC security groups. 6.2. Select the Default security group, click Inbound then click Edit. 6.3. Add a new rule called MS SQL, with Protocol as TCP and Port Range as 1433; and click Save. Parameter Store Identity and Access In the AWS Management Console navigate to IAM. Create a New IAM Policy: Click Policies, then select Create Policy. Select Import managed policy. Import a Managed Policy for SSM Access: Search for AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore and select it. Click Import. Add Additional Permissions for Parameter Store Access: Click Add additional permission. Choose Systems Manager as the service. Under Actions, select the following Read permissions: ssm:GetParameter ssm:GetParameters ssm:GetParametersByPath If write access is needed, also select ssm:PutParameter. Click Review Policy. Specify Resources to Limit Access Scope: Expand Resources. Instead of selecting All Resources, specify exact ARNs for the parameters needing access to ensure least privilege. Finalize the Policy Creation: Enter a Name and Description for the policy. Click Create Policy. Attach the Policy to the Appropriate Role: Search for the newly created policy. Select it and click Policy Actions. Choose Attach from the dropdown menu. Attach the policy to aws-elasticbeanstalk-service-role or another appropriate IAM role. Click Attach Policy. By following these refined steps, you ensure that access to AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store is both controlled and optimized while maintaining security best practices. Create Elastic Beanstalk Application The first step in using AWS Elastic Beanstalk is to create an application, which represents your web application in AWS. In Elastic Beanstalk an application serves as a container for the environments that run your web app and for versions of your web app's source code, saved configurations, logs, and other artifacts that you create while using Elastic Beanstalk. Open the Elastic Beanstalk console, and then, in the regions drop-down list, select your region. In the navigation pane, choose Applications, and then click Create Application. Use the on-screen form to provide an application name and click Create. Note You have successfully created the application. Next, we'll create the application's environments for each product: Subscription Manager, Data Stream Designer, and App Designer. Subscription Manager Create Environment Select the Application, click on Actions then click Create environment. Configure environment: Select Web server environment as the Environment tier. Provide the Environment name for Subscription Manager. Select .NET on Windows Server and select the supported version. Select Sample Application and under Presets, select Custom configuration. Click Next. Configure service access: Configure and click Next. Setup networking, database, and tags - optional: Configure and click Next. Configure Instance traffic and scaling: For the Capacity section, select Load Balanced under Environment Type and set the required Instance Min and Max to 1. (More information can be found here). For the Listener Section, add a new listener with the following configure: Port: 443 Protocol: HTTPS SSL certificate: Select the SSL certificate you added in the Certificate Manager earlier. For the Processes Section, select the default Process and under Actions click Edit and update to: Port: 443 Protocol: HTTPS Health check\\Path: /favicon.ico Sessions\\Stickiness policy enabled: True Click Next Configure updates, monitoring, and logging – optional: Configure and click Next. Review: Review the previous configuration and click Submit. While the environment is created, take note of the load balancer created in the logs. e.g Created Load Balancer listener named: arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-1:142725982179:listener/app/awseb-- AWSEB- itYC8AXwyswd/a0e5dc6a6ad0a418/fcd8ccc52761bd5d. Hosting Zone Configuration In the AWS Management Console navigate to Route 53. In the navigation pane, click Hosted Zones and find the one created for SM. Create a new record with the following configuration. Record name: keep blank Record type: A – Routes traffic to an IPv4 address and some AWS resources Alias: True Route trafic to: Endpoint: Alias to Application and Classic Load Balancer Region: The region of where the Environment was deployed Now supply the load balance created when Environment was deployed earlier. Create S3 Bucket Create the S3 Bucket In the AWS Management Console, navigate to S3 Click Create Bucket. Enter a unique bucket name and select your AWS region. Scroll down to the Block Public Access settings section. Uncheck \"Block all public access\" (AWS strongly recommends keeping this enabled for security reasons). Click Create bucket. Configure Public Access Open your newly created bucket. 2. Go to the Permissions tab. 3. Under Bucket policy, click Edit and enter this policy: replace your-bucket-name with your actual bucket name. { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Sid\": \"PublicReadGetObject\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Principal\": \"*\", \"Action\": \"s3:GetObject\", \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*\" } ] } Click Save changes. Set Public Object Permissions Navigate to the Objects tab inside your bucket. Upload a file and select it. Click Permissions and set Public access. Confirm changes. Security Considerations AWS strongly discourages making entire buckets publicly accessible due to security risks. Note The signing certificate is between the end user and the load balancer. The instance SSL certificate is used between the instances and the load balancer.

Certificate and Communication Steps Signing Certificate Subscription Manager manages Identity and access for the whole XMPro Platform. To do this, it regularly issues authentication tokens to the users as they log into the system. The server must sign these tokens to ensure their validity, hence a signing certificate is required. A PKCS 12 archived certificate .pfx file is required. The minimum length of the accepted private key is 2048. Follow the instructions below to generate a Signing certificate: Download and install OpenSSL for Windows Open a command prompt as administrator and navigate to the OpenSSL install directory. The default location is C:\\Program Files\\OpenSSL-Win64 Run the following commands cd C:\\Program Files\\OpenSSL-Win64 cd bin openssl genrsa -out sign.pem 2048 openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -nodes -keyout sign.key -out sign.crt -subj \"/CN={YourMachine}\" -days 3650 openssl pkcs12 -export -out sign.pfx -inkey sign.key -in sign.crt -certfile sign.crt Follow the prompts on the screen and complete the certificate request Make a note of the Common Name (\"/CN='') and Password you choose Create a file called sign.password.txt and add the password to the file Note The resulting sign.pfx and sign.password.txt files will be required during the installation. HTTPS/SSL Certificate The XMPro Platform enforces secure communication using HTTPS/SSL. This means the server it is deployed to must have HTTPS configured. Depending on the deployment option you choose, you may have the following options: Order a certificate from a certificate authority (CA) Create a certificate in AWS (AWS deployment only) Create a self-signed certificate (On-Premise only) Note The DNS or hostname that users are expected to use to browse to the XMPro Platform must correspond to the SSL Certificate Common Name. Creating Self-Signed Certificate through PowerShell If you need to create a self-signed certificate, open Windows PowerShell as administrator and follow the instructions below: Run the New-SelfSignedCertificate cmdlet as shown below to add a certificate to the local store on your PC, replacing the fully qualified domain name (FQDN). $cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -certstorelocation cert:\\localmachine\\my -dnsname <FQDN> Create a password as shown below, used for the export in the following step. $pwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -String 'Enter Strong Password' -Force -AsPlainText Export the self-signed certificate using the Export-PfxCertificate cmdlet as shown below. $path = 'cert:\\localMachine\\my\\' + $cert.thumbprint Export-PfxCertificate -cert $path -FilePath c:\\cert.pfx -Password $pwd Note The directory you specify in step 3's -FilePath parameter must already exist. Create a txt file with the name cert.password.txt and add the certificate password to this file. Creating Self-Signed Certificate through IIS The self-signed certificate can also be generated through IIS, following the instructions below: Open IIS Manager and click \"Server Certificates\" Click \"Create Self-Signed Certificate\" Enter \"cert\" for the Certificate name, select \"Personal\" for the certificate store, and click OK Confirm the certificate is generated and listed on 'Server Certificates' Right click on the certificate and Export, taking note of the location and password entered for later use SMTP Account XMPro components use emails to notify users of certain events, for instance, a new User signed up, or your account is ready. Please set up an SMTP account and have the necessary server details, as these are required for the notifications to work. TLS/SSL Security TLS encryption is required for secure email transmission Use port 587 (STARTTLS) for modern secure email delivery Enable SSL must be set to \"true\" in configuration Account Configuration You will need the following details from your email provider: Setting Value Description Smtp Server Your provider's SMTP server address The fully qualified domain name of your SMTP server (e.g. smtp.office365.com) User Name Your SMTP account username Often the same as your email address (e.g. noreply@mydomain.com) Password Your SMTP account password Secure authentication credentials Port 587 Required for TLS (STARTTLS) encryption Enable SSL true Must be enabled for secure transmission Twilio Account (Optional) App Designer uses SMS, among other means, to notify users of certain events e.g. a recommendation alert was triggered or resolved, etc. An SMS provider is required to send SMS notifications. Please set up an account at Twilio using these instructions and have the necessary details handy, i.e. Account ID, Authorization Token, and the Phone Number."

    "summary": "v4.1.13 App Designer Change Type Description Feature New Blocks added: Azure Digital Twin Hierarchy - An interactive UI component that visualizes a large amount of time-oriented data. It allows the user to compare data at run-time based on asset ID by dropping markers on the chart, as well as panning and zooming, and can show or hide specific assets or parameters via the hierarchy panel. Image Map - allows you to render dynamic and static content onto an Image. You can drag on content such as indicators or text and these render on top of the image at runtime, at the specified coordinates. A new Unity Block was added to support Unity 2020 and above. The previous Unity Block was renamed Unity (Legacy) and continues to support Unity 2019. Feature Connector Logs allow the composer of an App, the developer writing a new Connector, or an Administrator to view messages generated by a Connector when it is in use as a Connection in an App. Feature Alerts for selected Recommendations can be added as markers to time series data: Azure Digital Twin Hierarchy Time Series Chart Time Series Insights (Edit: subsequently deprecated) Enhancement A new property, Store User Selection, has been added to the Dropdown Grid and Select Box Blocks. Enable it to remember the user's selection when the page loads on these blocks that take more than one value. Enhancement Extend the Tree Grid with the following: Allow Drag & Drop is now independent of Allow Updating, so you can choose whether users can amend the hierarchy, the data, or both. Added Hyperlink, Lookup, and Indicator column types Added Store User Selection, to remember the user's selection when the page loads Enhancement Format numeric output in the Data Grid and Tree Grid as currency or percentage. Enhancement Extend the Tab Block to allow for App page reuse with the new Hide Tab Navigation property Enhancement Time Series Chart hierarchy selection pop-up widened to avoid truncating parameter names. Enhancement Consolidated Data Stream Connection mapping added the App Import to simplify moving Apps between environments. Enhancement SVG file types are supported for all image properties. See here for a full list of supported image file types. Enhancement The current app page URL parameters (appId, appVersion, pageId, categoryId and categoryName) were added to the expression editor so that a back URL can be passed to a drill-down when using the Navigate To property. Enhancement Renamed 'Open in New Window' to 'Open in New Tab/Window' under Navigate To property and expanded the documentation. Enhancement Add a tooltip to the Text Block and the Fieldset Block's Field Label. This is useful to keep the text short and use a tooltip for longer descriptions. The Fieldset's padding and margin now default to 0 (previously 20 and 30px). The styling is now consistent with other Blocks with the padding coming from the container e.g. Stacked Layout. Enhancement Extend the Map Block to overlay an image or Geo Json pattern on Google Maps. Enhancement The height of the Quick Expression Editor was increased from 1 to 4 lines and scrollbars were added too. Enhancement Added font-size support for relative css units vh and vw to the Typography option. Fix Recommendation Block not refreshing results when using dynamic Entity Id. Implement auto refresh when using a dynamic Entity Id. Fix Unable to Navigate To URL from Chart Block. Exposed Chart's Show Drilldown property. Enable this when using Actions such as Navigate To. Fix Keyboard input is disabled at runtime after rendering Unity. Follow this guide to prevent the keyboard input from being locked to the Unity model. Fix Time Series Chart fixes: The timestamp dropdown doesn't scroll when there are more than 30 columns and can no longer be filtered with text. The cause was 2 columns with the same name, but different capitalization. A Connector configuration now warns about case sensitivity and prevents duplicated column names. Clicking the Internal Size unit dropdown caused a logic dialog to open too Only the unit dialog opens When specifying many selections, the header does not wrap so not all of the series names are visible and long names are truncated. A scrollbar has been added to the individual names as well as the chart header. The Pan & Zoom mode affects this panel only. The displayed data now expands to fill space created by a compacted Pan & Zoom panel. Parameters are not passed when reading the max timestamp. Parameters defined on the data source are now passed for both the min and max timestamps. A hidden chart (Visible is dynamically bound) makes an unexpected data call. This affects all Blocks: the data source is now refreshed when the control becomes visible rather than on initialization. Fix Tree Grid is stuck loading once expanded and several levels are clicked. There may be a delay while the controls are refreshed, but the App will not freeze. Data Stream Designer Change Type Description Enhancement A visual indicator that a Data Stream has started successfully has been added to the Stream Metrics. In the past, you would've had to publish your Data Stream and wait for events in the Live View - or utilize a console Stream Host and view its log - as confirmation there were no errors when publishing. Enhancement The Agent single and bulk upload now prepopulates the Agent category - when specified in the .xmp file. The Agent upload process is now a single file per tier because the category is clear for Agent families like CSV and SQL. Fix Cannot upload Tier 5 Agents The Agent bulk upload file size was increased. Fix The Refresh button on the Logs blade clears the table but doesn't reload the logs. The Refresh button reloads the logs. Subscription Manager Change Type Description Enhancement Optional functionality to sync the user's Business Role to a corresponding Azure AD Claim each time they log in. SSO using Azure AD is a pre-requisite. Package Manager Change Type Description Enhancement You can run multiple instances of Package Manager at the same time. This side-by-side comparison is helpful when developing a new Agent or Connector that is similar to another or different versions of the same Agent. Enhancement When packaging an Agent or Connector, you can opt to export the configuration as a JSON file too. This is useful either to compare packages or for source control and version management. Enhancement You can package the Agent's Category so that it is prepopulated when uploading to Data Stream Designer. The Agent name defaults to the preferred format [Category]_[Name]_v[Version].xmp Fix Package Manager crashes when adding a Group with no contents. An empty Group type caused the issue and is now defaulted. Fix Package Manager crashes when adding an option to a Drop Down for a Connector. Drop Down options can now be added to Connectors too. Common Change Type Description Enhancement The App Designer and Data Stream Designer landing page styling has been refreshed, including labeling the category card statistics. When selecting a category in App Designer, the Applications can be filtered by status and tag. Yes, you can now tag Applications too. When selecting a category in Data Stream Designer, the Data Streams can be filtered by status, tag, and/or collection; and Stream Metrics can be switched on for those which are published. Enhancement The description text height on Application and Data Stream imports has been increased so that it can be read without scrolling. Fix Special characters broke the Azure deployment script. The Azure deployment script was updated to specify the few unsupported special characters for passwords. Fix Single Sign Out Issue when a user signs out of one company to switch to another company, the previous company name and categories were still visible in tabs open for other products. Signing out of one product completely signs a user out of all products. v4.1.13.1 Change Type Description Fix Optional properties were treated as required when adding or upgrading a Connector. Optional properties behave as expected and don't require values. Fix The tab selection was not caching correctly on the first tab of a Tab Block. So another tab stayed selected, even after refreshing - or navigating away and returning to the App page. The first tab would fail to cache, this has now been resolved. Fix Widening the Time Series Chart hierarchy selection pop-up in v4.1.13 - to avoid truncating parameter names - caused the list to shift out of view if a resource icon is clicked. Reverted the hierarchy prompt to its original size, but made the size adjustable. You can now click on either the resource icon or name. v4.1.13.2 Change Type Description Enhancement The Beta tag indicates incremental functionality, added to prepare for a future feature. For example, the factors added to Recommendations in preparation for a future Scoring enhancement. Enhancement The Time Series Chart now supports dynamic range and initial selection, which determines the starting date for the Pan & Zoom and the time interval that is initially selected. Enhancement Azure AD SSO now allows for Guest User access across tenants. Fix Data Source expressions were not available for selection in the Time Series Chart configuration. Data stream expressions now appear correctly in the Time Series Chart. Fix Alerts were navigable without run access. Restricted access to alerts for which the user does not have run access. v4.1.13.3 Change Type Description Enhancement Released an early access Database Migration tool for automating new database installs and upgrades. Fix Time Series Chart fix: the Initial Selection's Unit of Time was using hours when dynamic, despite being set as another option in the static value. The Initial Selection's Unit of Time is correctly applied. v4.1.13.4 Note XMPro has changed its product URLs. A redirect is in place for the sign-in page, but we recommend that you bookmark the new URLs for future reference: https://xmpro-sm.azurewebsites.net/ https://xmpro-ds.azurewebsites.net/ https://xmpro-ad.azurewebsites.net/ Change Type Description Enhancement Hyperlink columns in a Data or Tree Grid now have the option to open in the same or a new tab/window. We recommend opening XMPro URLs in the same tab/browser if the app design means it is likely a user will drill down into multiple tabs in a single sitting. A large number of XMPro tabs open at the same time is likely to cause performance-related issues. Enhancement The Time Series Chart's initial selection's unit of time is now a standalone property (here) for intuitive configuration. Update We've reduced our Linux-based Stream Host offering to support Ubuntu only, to increase our test coverage and ability to release often. Linux RHEL and Debian Stream Hosts are no longer supported. Fix The detailed view of a Recommendation Alert - including its event data - is visible to users with run access, whether it was accessed through manipulation of URL string parameters or not. An error message advising they do not have access is displayed. Fix The parent blade name (or menu item on primary blades) was used as the default tooltip in blades across all products. Tooltips are only showing where intended. v4.1.13.5 Change Type Description Fix The Help blade across all products showed the major version i.e. 4.1.0.0. The Help blade now shows the public release version e.g. 4.1.13.5. Fix An issue was introduced in 4.1.13.4, where Recommendation Category names were not editable. Recommendation Category names can be amended."

    "summary": "v4.2.0 App Designer Change Type Description Feature The new feature, Recommendation Scoring, allows for further fine-tuning of alert rankings to aid in prioritization. This feature utilizes a scoring system that takes into account multiple Score Factors that can be configured within: - Recommendation - Recommendation Category - Recommendation Rule. A Score Matrix was added to allow you to see the score and the corresponding recommendation, category and rule that comprise of the score. This provides greater visibility and understanding of the score composition. Feature A timeline of events is now available for Recommendations, Rules and Recommendation Categories. This feature enables you to view the changes made to a recommendation or category and the user who performed them. The timeline includes search and filtering options to facilitate the viewing of changes/events. Enhancement The Recommendation Landing Page has been updated to include sorting by scoring, allowing users to view the calculated score and alert ID. This enhancement facilitates the prioritization of alerts that require more attention. Enhancement Creating Recommendation Categories has been moved to a new blade to accommodate the addition of the score factor. Enhancement Recommendation Alerts that are Auto Escalated will now be automatically assigned to the previous owner of the alert. Enhancement Hyperlinks in Tree Grid and Data Grid now default to opening within the same tab. This is done to make viewing hyperlinks more responsive. Enhancement General system performance improvements were made to make a more responsive user experience. Enhancement General security updates were added. Fix The Time Series Chart's Data Source Parameters were not accessible by its parent Hierarchy. This issue has been resolved. Data Stream Designer Change Type Description Enhancement Introduced a visual indicator to the Data Stream Designer's canvas and toolbox to better distinguish the Agent's Category using color and text. Enhancement The Stream Host runtime has been upgraded, taking advantage of the enhanced performance and features of .NET Core 6. For more information on installing Stream Hosts, please visit this link. Subscription Manager Change Type Description Enhancement The new site setting, Hide Users Outside Business Role Branch, allows you to control whether users can see the details of other users outside of their business role. This is useful when the structure makeup is confidential. Enhancement General security updates were added."

Enhancement On auto-escalated alerts, a hyperlink has been added to the original alert. Fix Unable to add a variable name that had been used before. The error has been resolved. Fix The upgrade introduced an error on newly added checkboxes - the internal value changed when clicked but not the UI. When adding a Check Box Block to a page, the default state is now unchecked and the default label is \"Checkbox\". Fix If two users try to concurrently manage the run access of an application, an error is triggered for the user who saves their change last. The run access is updated in real-time for both sessions. Data Stream Designer Change Type Description Enhancement The new site setting, Enable Stream Metrics, allows you to toggle on and off the Stream Load and Stream Errors cards on the Stream Metrics panel. It applies to both the published Data Stream canvas and the list of Data Stream cards accessed from the landing page. While these two metrics are valuable during the development lifecycle, the toggle is useful as they do impact performance. Fix Unable to open the error flow canvas or import streams that use it. The Canvas now switches from the data flow to the error flow canvas, which contains the error agent. Fix The error displayed when Categories' stats on the Data Stream home page has been resolved."

The Data Source and Search filters are both applied. Common Change Type Description Fix Users are unable to upload an avatar to their profile. The issue has been fixed. Fix During upgrades and new installations: there was a warning that the default user did not have a business role. the silent renewal process fails for the default user and an expiry message is shown. The default user is added to the 'All Employees' business role during the installation. The warning has been removed because a user's business role is not mandatory.

You can use this list to verify the current version of the Data Stream in use and make any necessary updates if required. Common Change Type Description Feature The new health check feature provides initial troubleshooting of the health of XMPro services. It displays the status of the XMPro services along with their ability to establish timely connections. It is also possible to add third-party endpoints to monitor all of your health checks in a central location. Enhancement The installation process of the XMPro application on Azure infrastructure has been improved: the application version number is now appended to the \"mainTemplate.json\" filename. For instance, the filename would be \"mainTemplate_4.2.3.json\" for version 4.2.3 of the application. Fix SSO logins post initial login fails for guest accounts.

Subscription Manager Change Type Description Enhancement The Subscription page now shows the license expiry date and the number of days remaining. Previously, the global or company admin would have to open each subscription to view the expiration date of a license. Common Change Type Description Feature Logging provider support via Serilog, a diagnostic logging library, enhances system logging functionality to provide administrators with valuable insights into the behavior and performance of XMPro. Three logging outputs are supported: Logging to file support has been added for all XMPro products, whereas Application Insights and Datadog support has been added for all products aside from Subscription Manager. These are cloud-based application monitoring and analytics services. Enhancement Standard logging has been improved across all products with the addition of more contextual information. Users can now access important details such as CompanyId, CompanyName, UserId, Username, and more, enabling efficient issue investigation. Enhancement We've changed the way our database installs and upgrades are applied. For new installs, our products will automatically install the required database changes. For upgrades, our products will detect what database changes are needed and make these. We are moving away from doing database installs and upgrades from the desktop installer, with all database installs and upgrades happening automatically from within the products. Accelerate time to value by choosing to automatically deploy the regular, smaller releases to your pre-prod environment, rather than less frequent, larger upgrades. Fix SignalR displayed errors in the browser console. These errors have been rectified. Fix An issue has been resolved where the on-premise installer failed to create an AWS package. Fix Access token vulnerabilities have been addressed. XMPro has masked logging of sensitive data like access_tokens used in SignalR connections to align with best practices. Fix When assigning Run Access to XMPro Objects, selection changes were lost if you scrolled out of sight (further down) in the user list. Selections are retained through scrolling and saved as expected. Fix The link in the Help Blades' \"Release Notes\" section did not direct users to the version number that matched the release version of XMPro when they tried to navigate to it.

In this release, access and product rights were added to low-priority recommendation, variable, and application endpoints. Fix The Unity Block does not show a data stream's real-time values updated on the model when using a connector with live updates. Live data is supported on the Unity block. Fix Non-admin user is unable to save, resolve, or send discussion messages on alerts to which they have run access (Error message: Sorry, something went wrong. Unable to send message.) Users with the View Recommendation Alert product access right and Run Access for an alert can interact with it. Fix Although Log Data On was set to 'All Occurrences', the Event Data was not updated if the Rule's Recurrence was 'First Occurrence'. With the same configuration, one alert is generated but the event data is updated with every occurrence that the rule logic is met. Fix Users able to delete connector versions see the total usage count. Previously, admins saw the total connector version usage, and everyone else saw the usage in apps to which they had access. Now users with DeleteConnector rights can also see the total usage - empowering them to see which connector versions can be deleted. Fix The Connector Usage Details report does not match the Connector Usage report when an Application has multiple versions. Application Version was added to the Connector Usage Details report and the total matches the summary report. XMPro Notebook Change Type Description Enhancement Added OpenCV Python to the default XMPro Notebook libraries."

The Overflow property was added to all Visual and Recommendation Blocks. Designers can determine whether block styling covers the corners of child elements (hidden) or not (visible). Fix The Indicator Block color can be set using a static value, but using a quick expression has no effect at runtime. As a workaround, set a variable using the expression and bind the variable to the Color property. The Indicator Block color can be set using a static value or a quick expression.

    "summary": "v4.4.0 Warning We strongly recommend that all Stream Host installations are upgraded to this version and that the feature flag 'Enable Luigi Preview', is enabled to leverage the enhanced capabilities fully. If you upgrade to the XMPro Product Suite v4.4.0 but continue using an older Stream Host (v4.3.12 or earlier), you will have a degraded experience because the Stream Host logs will not be visible in Data Stream Designer. This applies to both Stream-specific logs and Collection Logs in general. Integrations Change Type Name Description New Azure OpenAI v1.02 Prompt your model with real-time sensor values. New Fixed Width File Reader v1.0 Process data from fixed-width text files in your data stream. New OPC DA Listener and Action Agent Read and publish tag values to an OPC DA Server in your data stream. Enhancement Azure Digital Twin Listener v1.08 Query support added. Useful for splitting a model into submodels and joining separate queries if you've reached the DTDL limit of 300 properties. Enhancement Azure IoT Hub Listener v3.06 Support Array Values visualization in the Live View. Enhancement Calculated Field Transformation v3.44 Added error handling to prevent circular dependencies in expressions. Do not use - compatible with Stream Host v4.4.0 and v4.4.1 only. Enhancement OPC DA Listener v1.45 Support including the tag value's quality in your output. Enhancement OSIsoft PI Connector v1.13 Added rounding support and error handling when no results are returned. Enhancement Salesforce Context Provider v3.00 Added support for filtering on dates, escape characters, result count, and selecting which columns to return. Enhancement Row Count Transformation v1.12 Added group and sort of data and assign distinct row numbers to each group. Enhancement XML File Reader Action Agent v1.18 Added support to batch process multiple files. Common Change Type Description Enhancement We've listened to your feedback and made several usability enhancements to file keys and dashboard tags: Introduced an eye on all import and export functions: if you click on the file key eye, what you have typed will show up to enable you to check the typing of your file key. Improved how multiple tags are shown on a card: the ellipsis was replaced with a horizontal scrollbar and the white space was reduced. Global search: tags were added as an option and can be searched too. Category Filter: your tag selection is persisted as you open and close Apps and Data Streams, so that you don't need to reapply your filter Enhancement Various application upgrades: Upgrade XMPro Notebook, Application Designer, Data Stream Designer, and Stream Hosts to .NET 8. Enable http2 on Azure ARM deployments Upgrade SignalR packages to latest compatible versions Fix WebSocket connection errors in some Apps in some environments. Intermittent SignalR connection failures due to long query strings or incompatible client/server versions were resolved. Fix Selecting the Network Service account during an On-Premise installation causes app files to fail and the inability to write logs to the Application Directory. The On-Premise installation documentation now advises to select \"Local System\" when opting for a built-in security account. XMPro AI and Notebook Change Type Description Feature XMPro AI and Notebook are now available to deploy via an XMPro-assisted ARM template. Enhancement Upgrade the XMPro Notebook's default Python library version from 3.8 to 3.10. App Designer Change Type Description Feature The new feature, Metablocks, is the first step towards plug-and-play Blocks. The first two Metablocks, Unity and Unity (Legacy), demonstrate how the modular approach improves performance. It opens up the ability to support different web technologies. Feature New Blocks added: Tree Map - visualize hierarchical data as well as the order of magnitude, for example, to create a quick view of high-volume situations. Live Feed - incorporate your IP Live Feed camera into an application alongside key statistics related to the area under surveillance. Enhancement As highlighted in v4.3.8, we can do better for data privacy by adding more stringent authorization controls to authenticated endpoints. In this release, access and product rights were added to the final batch of endpoints: low-priority recommendation, application, connector, and integration endpoints. Enhancement We've listened to your feedback and made several usability enhancements to the App Designer Canvas: Block Toolbar: tooltips were added to highlight the button functions. Block Styling: advanced options - rarely used except by advanced users - were moved to a new Advanced Styling accordion to simplify your styling choices. Block Styling: Font Style was added to Typography, adding support for italic and oblique text. Page Layers: added a horizontal scrollbar for when there are multiple nested layers of components on a page. Blocks tab: show 3 tiles per row so that it is quicker to locate a Block. Dynamic and expression block properties: added a Full Name property to the User Details - and renamed User to Username for increased clarity. Data Streams Connector: prefix the entity with the data source version so that you don't have to open and scroll to verify the correct version is in use. Enhancement These Tree Grid Block navigation and selection features were added: 'Expand All Rows By Default' property, is useful when you have a small dataset. 'Allow Multiple Select' property, as per the Data Grid. Node run-time context menu to expand and collapse its children. Enhancement ViewAppBar right, added in v4.1.0, is now included in all default App Designer roles. Global admins have the option to customize the product roles for specific implementations. Enhancement Append the underlying connector integration error to the \"Unable to get integration details\" error message, to allow for effective troubleshooting. For example, a 500 error may indicate an unsupported Azure Digital Twin configuration. Enhancement The option to export to Excel was added to the Recommendation Alerts grid. Fix Non-Admin users encountered an error ('Unable to save notification subscription changes') when subscribing to recommendation notifications. Non-Admin Users can now amend their Notification Settings. Fix The category filter's checkboxes no longer overlap the text. Fix Clicking the Site Setting Report carats opens an empty blade. Users can click on the carat or the report name to open it. Fix The Azure Digital Twin Connector's 'Query Text Area' is not maximized when the blade is maximized. For all Connectors that utilize a Script Box in their configuration, the editable area is expanded when the configuration blade is maximized. Fix A Connector was accidentally written that included credentials in an error message, which was displayed to a standard User when they encountered the error while running an App that used the Connector. Connector error messages are available in the logs to those with appropriate access, such as administrators, and a generic error message is reported to end users. Fix Tooltips on Button Blocks are now shown at runtime. Fix Font selection is ignored on the Data and Tree Grid Blocks at runtime. Font Block Styling is applied to the Data Grid, Tree Grid, and Tree List at runtime. Data Stream Designer Change Type Description Enhancement We've listened to your feedback and made several usability enhancements to the Data Stream Designer's Toolbox: Collapse the Toolbox when you're not using it to increase the canvas size. The Category header remains sticky as you scroll down so that you don't lose context and access the accordion to collapse the category. Enhancement The IPollingAgent interface was changed from required to recommended with the addition of a RequiresPolling property. This gives greater flexibility as typically non-polling agents can also poll. Enhancement The Adding an Agent hint was reworded for clarity to 'Max file size is 100 Mb. For a bulk upload, the limit applies to the unzipped size'. Enhancement The Agent's TokenBox behavior changed from a postback per selection of an item to when the selection is complete, i.e. focus is lost on the property. This is helpful when a designer needs to select multiple items and previously would have had to wait for the blade to reload each time. Fix Clicking the Site Setting Report carats opens an empty blade. Users can click on the carat or the report name to open it. Fix Closing a Data Stream from My Sandbox navigates back to the landing page. Closing a Data Stream navigates back to the previously selected category. Fix My Sandbox category tile appears on the home page despite containing no data streams. The 'My Sandbox' category tile is shown either if it contains data streams or if there are no data streams in other categories. Subscription Manager Change Type Description Feature Global Administrators can display a global notification across the XMPro suite for a specific period. This aids in communicating important information to users, such as planned maintenance downtime along with a hyperlink to release notes. Choose a type of hint, warning, or error to set the notification icon and banner color. The banner can be dismissed for a session. Fix An investigation into the progressive slow performance of SM revealed a correlation with an increasing number of memory handles. Notably, the number of handles consistently rises over time and only resets with a restart of the application process. The Subscription Manager memory leak issue has been addressed through optimized usage of the custom Identity Server ViewService. If you have noticed these symptoms, monitoring of memory, handles, and page response times is essential until Subscription Manager can be upgraded to v4.4.0 to resolve the issue. Fix The welcome email used the subject 'Welcome to XMPro'. All SM email notifications implement the template's title tag and only use 'Welcome to XMPro' if none was supplied in the template. Fix Users were advised their password reset had expired after they had entered a new password and clicked 'Update Password'. Users are advised their reset password link has expired when the reset password page loads. Fix The (email) SM Access Request Link redirects to App Designer if the user is already registered to App Designer. The SM access request link was suffixed with '/Home/Admin' to prevent unintended redirects. Fix The welcome email includes incorrect login details for those who sign up using SSO. The username provided is a generated username like user_domain_com#ext#mail.company, whereas the user should use their SSO email. The welcome email for users who sign up using SSO contains the correct login details. Stream Host Change Type Description Feature Stream Host optimizations are complete, ensuring more reliable orchestration of data streams and interactions such as publish, unpublish, sync with Data Stream Designer, and handling network disconnections. Although these improvements apply to both the rewritten core (Luigi) and the legacy core, to maximize the benefits of these optimizations, we highly recommend transitioning to the Luigi core. The Luigi core has transitioned out of its beta phase (v4.3.9) and is now the recommended Stream Host core as of this release (v4.4.0). Additionally, the Stream Host Logging to File section has been updated to accommodate changes in specifying the destination for log files. Enhancement The console output is colorized and formatted for readability, as well as more detail."

App Designer Change Type Description Enhancement Favorite your commonly used Blocks to access them more easily from a new Block category, Favorites. Enhancement The Metablock supports Value Mappings so that static, data source of expression values can be passed into the Metablock on page load. Fix I tried splitting my script into 3 and using the new Metablock, but my App is throwing 500 errors for the styling and script files. The single script file works as expected. The Metablock handles CSS and JavaScript injection at runtime, so explicit import code isn’t needed and will result in the 500 error. See here for more.

The signed out pages, where your preferred language is not known, are now available in Brazilian Portuguese, with other languages to follow. Subscription Manager is now available in Brazilian Portuguese, with other languages to follow. App Designer Change Type Description Fix Several issues were corrected on the Metablock: The default functions (onDataLoaded, onDataChanged, and onValueMappingLoaded) did not execute when added to a script tag on the HTML page. The Value Mapping was being called twice. The Value Mapping was not optional Fix I created a new Recommendation, but when I opened the Version blade I noticed the title was blank. The title of a new Recommendation default to \"Initial Version\". Fix I am the owner of a Recommendation, but I cannot view it's timeline - yet my colleague with Run Access can. Users with design access are able to view a Recommendation's timeline. Stream Host Change Type Description Fix I accidentally used the incorrect password on an MQTT agent and published the data stream. The stream did not start due to the connection error on the agent, but I noticed the agent continues attempting to connect to the MQTT broker. The Stream Host ensures that if a data stream fails to start or is unpublished, all of that stream's agents (whose Create() methods have already run) are destroyed."

Integrations Change Type Name Description Enhancement Meta Action Agent v1.12 Standardized the output payload property name and added guardrail to avoid incorrect setup. Replaced the logging endpoint with logging to the Stream Host for centralized monitoring. The following Agents were repackaged to translate the configuration properties: Change Type Name Translation Azure Data Explorer Listener v1.16 Azure Data Explorer Context Provider v1.14 Azure Data Explorer Reader v1.10 Azure Data Explorer Action Agent v1.06 Translation Azure Data Factory Action Agent v1.11 Translation Azure Data Lake Action Agent v1.21 Translation Azure Digital Twin Listener v1.10 Azure Digital Twin Context Provider v1.06 Azure Digital Twin Action Agent v1.22 Translation Azure Event Hub Listener v3.09 Azure Event Hub Action Agent v3.09 Translation Azure IoT Hub Listener v3.07 Translation Cognite Listener v1.22 Cognite Context Provider v1.32 Cognite Action Agent v1.02 Translation Email Listener v3.26 Email Action Agent v4.30 Email Download Action Agent v1.07 Translation Ethereum Smart Contract Listener v1.06 Ethereum Smart Contract Action Agent v1.05 Translation Excel File Reader Action Agent v1.13 Translation Litmus Edge OPC UA Listener v1.02 Litmus Edge OPC UA Action Agent v1.02 Translation MongoDB Listener v1.16 MongoDB Context Provider v1.16 MongoDB Action Agent v1.16 Translation MOVUS Alarms Listener v1.62 MOVUS Device Samples Listener v1.92 MOVUS Device Samples Context Provider v1.92 MOVUS Devices Context Provider v1.42 MOVUS Events Action Agent v1.02 Translation MySQL Listener v2.01 MySQL Context Provider v2.01 MySQL Action Agent v2.01 Translation Neo4j Listener v1.02 Neo4j Context Provider v1.02 Neo4j Action Agent v1.02 Translation OPC DA Listener v1.47 OPC DA Action Agent v1.34 Translation OPC UA Listener v4.03 OPC UA Action Agent v1.03 Translation Oracle Server Action Agent v1.02 Translation Snowflake Listener v1.01 Snowflake Context Provider v1.01 Snowflake Action Agent v1.04 Translation Twilio SMS Action Agent v2.16 Package Manager v1.3.18 Change Type Description Feature The ability to translate Agent and Connector properties into all languages supported by XMPro. You can use Azure OpenAI, or edit the JSON file. Feature The ability to import a JSON file, allowing changes to be made outside of Package Manager, and then imported to package an XMP file. Enhancement The ability to add a zip file as a reference, which is used by the Meta Agent when self-packaging. Enhancement A new category: \"Generative AI\", which will be available in Data Stream Designer shortly. Enhancement The references layout caters for integrations with many reference files: The reference type is shown in brackets after the file name. The Agent or Plugin file is shown first, with the rest of the files in alphabetical order. Files can be dragged and dropped into the files input. Enhancement The reference and settings lists scroll separately from their edit panels, thus the properties will not scroll when navigating through a long list. App Designer Change Type Description Deprecation The Autodesk Forge Block is deprecated. Please update your Apps by implementing the Metablock as shown in the example provided. Security The Azure Copilot and ChatGPT Copilot Block keys are now encrypted. Existing Apps will continue to work until they are edited. Keys entered manually entered will automatically encrypt themselves if the Block is selected, but you will need to save the App. Keys stored in variables will need to be changed to encrypted variables. Feature Embed Script is a new feature that allows company admins to integrate a JavaScript snippet into the pages of App Designer. This can be used to for a variety of purposes, ranging from collecting user analytics to a chatbot trained on company documentation. Enhancement The Metablock value mapping now supports variables, ensuring credentials for 3rd party libraries are not exposed. Enhancement Preferred Language is a new User Details expression that returns the regional language tag of the logged in user's preferred language. Use this to adjust text when an App will be used in multiple languages Enhancement Enhanced Date & Time Display in Grids. Date and DateTime columns in Data Grid and Tree Grid Blocks now automatically display in your browser's locale format, replacing the previous American date format (M/d/yyyy, h:mm a). You can override this by specifying your preferred format using the new \"Date Time Format\" property. Enhancement App export has a new advanced option and by default files in the uploads folder are excluded. When ticked, you can choose whether to include files added at runtime or exclude all files. This gives you greater control over which files to include, which affects the size of the file export. Enhancement New Image Storage Options for Blocks. Image and Image Map Blocks now support storing images in App Files through the new \"Image Source\" property. This enhancement allows images to be shared across multiple blocks and improves storage and retrieval efficiency. Previously, images could only be embedded within individual blocks. Fix I added a value mapping to my Metablock with a static key and an expression value. When I changed the key to dynamic, expression, and back to static, at runtime the mapping now shows the expression as text rather than the result of the expression, i.e. Reverse(\"foo\") and not \"oof\". Metablock expressions work as expected. Data Stream Designer Change Type Description Enhancement The \"Event Buffer\" property has been renamed to \"Agent Event Queue Capacity\" to more accurately represent its function on the Stream Host. Previously, this setting defined the queue limit in kilobytes, potentially leading to inconsistencies in event handling. Now, it specifies the maximum number of events, providing a more consistent approach to managing event queues across agents within a data stream. Fix I want to see who stopped my data stream, but the timeline view is blank. Sometimes the values in the context drop down are duplicated. A new \"Switch to archived Timeline\" button is available to access entries generated prior to upgrading to Data Stream v4.4.16+, and the context values are not duplicated. Fix My data stream's card is green to indicate it is published with no errors. When I open the data stream, I noticed the \"Started On\" stream metric is zero - so it had actually failed to start on all the Stream Hosts. The data stream's card status and \"Starting On\" stream metric are accurate. On the landing page, we've refined how the Active, Error, and Draft counts are tabulated. We've fine-tuned how device failure counts in active stream hosts are tracked and updated when stream hosts disconnect. Subscription Manager Change Type Description Fix I added a license to my new company, but the expiry date didn't appear until I added a user to the subscription. The license expiry date is now shown immediately after applying the license."

Requests are proxied so that credentials inside the Metablock are not exposed when sending messages via WebSockets. You can now authenticate securely and simply using encrypted server variable value mappings in a WebSocket/MQTT message. Allowed Downloads security feature. We've enabled this security feature so that you can build a Metablock that includes file download functionality. Utilize multiple script files using App Files. Although the Metablock supports a single HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file, you can now reference App Files as a source for additional resource files. This means you can have multiple files rather than consolidating into a single file. Fix I was able to mark an Alert as resolved, even though there was a required Form field. Resolve Alert Action Block respect required Form fields as expected (i.e. a False Positive can be used without filling in required Form fields. Fix I configured a Time Series Analytics Block with a range of 12 hours, initial selection of 3 hours. When I launch the App, the range is 3 hours and the initial selection is 3 minutes. An error introduced in v4.4.17 has been corrected and the Time Series Analysis Block filter works as expected. Data Stream Designer Change Type Description Enhancement Favorite your commonly used Agents to visually identify them with a star. In future, we'll add a new Favorites category so you can access them more easily. NuGet Packages Common Change Type Description Enhancement Modernize and enable publishing of NuGet packages. This enriches NuGet package metadata and introduces SourceLink capabilities to enhance the Developer experience. Maintenance Implement EditorConfig and apply Whitespace and Usings rules, ensuring uniformity in internal coding style. Agent Development XMPro.XMIoT.Framework Change Type Description Security Updated third-party dependencies to maintain optimal security standards. Enhancement Support Agent property translations with a new property, TranslationMap. Enhancement Support a zipped file to be packaged in an Agent. Enhancement When an Agent and the Stream Host supply the same assembly, the correct one is selected. In addition, detailed debug information is now logged when loading agent assemblies to better troubleshoot Agent and Stream Host issues. There is a check for certain agent assembly loading conditions, which will be visible in the Data Stream log viewer. Enhancement The IPollingAgent interface was changed from required to recommended with the addition of a RequiresPolling property. This gives greater flexibility as typically non-polling agents can also poll. Maintenance Remove redundant Hybrid and Cloud Agent types - only Edge is supported. Maintenance Remove redundant Java references - only Agents written in C# or using the Meta Agent are supported. Maintenance Remove SCC references from csproj files - redundant in current source control. Connector Development XMPro.Integration.Framework Change Type Description Enhancement Added parameters to the Connector's Subscribe method, used to implement live updates on data sources. Connector creators can implement the same pre-defined filtering and sorting applied when an App Page is refreshed. Enhancement The new ITSCConnector interface instructs the Time Series Chart to use optimized client-side querying. Use it when building new TSC Connectors that pre-process large volumes of data and return it in buckets. Later, the ITSAConnector interface was added (to reflect the Time Series Analysis Block renamed in v4.4.9) and the ITSCConnector interface deprecated. XMPro.Integration.Helpers No additional changes.

Change Type Description Security As part of our ongoing commitment to product security and stability, we've implemented several improvements in this release: • Mitigated high-severity CVE-2025-27598 in App Designer, Data Stream Designer, and AI Designer by upgrading SixLabors.ImageSharp from 3.1.5 to 3.1.7. • Expanded the automated test coverage for Recommendations. Security Ubuntu 20.04 LTS will reach its end of standard support on 31 May 2025. Running the XMPro Stream Host on an unsupported operating system may expose your environment to security vulnerabilities and compliance risks. XMPro strongly recommends using the Docker-based Stream Host as the preferred method for all new installations and upgrades, and is supported on a wide range of modern platforms, including newer Ubuntu LTS releases. Fix A change in v4.4.18 caused SSO integration with Azure AD to behave differently for guest accounts, and users are requested to link them again. This has been resolved without requiring any changes to the guest username. Documentation The installation content for AWS and Windows Server 2022 (previously known as \"On-Prem\") have been updated. When upgrading XMPro instances that use AI Notebooks installed via ARM deployments, you may encounter known issues with the automated upgrade process. The Azure installation has been updated with manual workarounds. Integrations Agents Change Type Name Description New Timeseries Logger v1.00 Allows you to capture timeseries data for selected parameters. Enhancement Ollama GenAI v2.02 Replaced Python backend with REST API. Enhancement Binary Classification ML v1.08 Support Linux Stream Hosts & upgrade the Microsoft.ML NuGet package. Fix Meta Action Agent v1.14 Fixed backward compatibility issue introduced in v1.12. However, logging to the Data Stream Logs will take effect when used with Stream Host v4.4.19+. Package Manager v4.4.19. From this release onwards, the Package Manager version will align with the product version. Change Type Description Fix Several errors introduced in v1.13.18 were addressed: • Crashes when saving new Connector • Empty XMP files generated when saving an Agent App Designer Change Type Description Documentation The Metablock documentation was updated to clarify that only plain text values are supported for encrypted Server Variables value mapping. Stream Host Change Type Description Enhancement Configuration Simplification Gateway ID and Gateway Name are now optional parameters. If not provided, the system will auto-generate a GUID for Gateway ID and use the format [Image-Version]-[Gateway Id] for Gateway Name, reducing required configuration steps. Enhancement Unified Container Repository All Stream Host images are now consolidated under the single xmpro.azurecr.io/stream-host repository. The previous separate xmprocontrib.azurecr.io repository has been eliminated for simplified image management. Enhancement Streamlined Image Variants Reduced image complexity from 4+ variants to 3 clear options with version-specific tagging that includes base OS and Python version, making it easier to choose the right container image for your deployment: • 4.4.19-bookworm-slim (Debian) • 4.4.19-bookworm-slim-python3.12 (Debian with Python) • 4.4.19-alpine3.21 (Alpine) Enhancement Simplified Deployment Experience Minimum required environment variables reduced from 6 to 3 for basic setup. Basic deployment examples no longer require separate .env files, making initial configuration more straightforward. Documentation Improved Documentation and Examples Added hardware requirements sizing guidelines, shell-specific examples for PowerShell and Bash/Terminal, improved Docker Compose YAML structure with better commenting, and Git Bash compatibility support with MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 for Windows users, providing clearer setup guidance and reducing deployment troubleshooting time. NuGet Packages Agent Development XMPro.XMIoT.Framework Change Type Description Enhancement The IAgentLogger interface was added so that Agents can log errors, information, and warning messages to the Data Stream Logs, whereas the existing IPublishError publishes to the output error endpoint.

Fix Calculated Field Transformation v3.45 Replacement for v3.44 released in v4.4.0, which was not backward compatible with older Stream Hosts (pre v4.40). Fix Run Recommendation v2.64 Collection was modified error. Fixed a rare concurrent access exception when fetching updated rules. Fix Python Agent v1.65 Fixed a rare issue where the python agent when used in certain combinations of agents in a data stream would cause the SH to stop, subsequentially stopping all Data Streams that SH runs. The issue was introduced in v1.61 of the agent where it was packaged incorrectly. App Designer Change Type Description Enhancement The Visual Media Capture Block's App File storage has been replaced with external storage providers, i.e. Azure Blob and Amazon S3. Note: this is not backward compatible and you will need to update the block configuration if you used it in v4.4.1. Fix My lightweight App or App Page fails to export. We've optimized how we store grid filter properties, reducing the exported App size. Subscription Manager Change Type Description Enhancement Microsoft .NET Framework upgrade from 4.7.2 to 4.8.1 Fix The default Subscription Manager log to file path is accessible through a web browser. The default log to file location is App_Data, which is hidden by default globally on IIS and therefore not public. Stream Host Change Type Description Feature A Docker Stream Host image is now supported. Enhancement New free trial Stream Hosts will be deployed as docker containers, rather than Azure Webjobs. In the future, this will become the recommended Stream Host deployment. Enhancement Utilize environment variables to override variables for a Stream Host, best suited when running the Stream Host in Docker. Note: the prefix changed from xm: to xmvariable__. Enhancement We've improved the encryption of agent parameters and variables. A new enableLegacyCrypto feature flag, which defaults to false, allows you to revert to the historic encryption method. We recommend sticking with the new method as the legacy method will eventually be deprecated. If you're running Data Stream Designer v4.2.2+, no action is necessary. If xmpro:XMCryptography:TripleDES:Key is specified in the configuration, a warning log will inform this is obsolete and can be removed. If you're running Data Stream Designer older than v4.4.2, you must: add xmpro:Gateway:FeatureFlags:EnableLegacyCrypto=true to the config specify the xmpro:XMCryptography:TripleDES:Key configuration (go to Data Stream Designer's site settings and copy the Encryption Key) If you don't, the Stream Host will fail at start-up and the resulting log will remind you to take the above actions. An older Stream Host with an older Data Stream Designer will continue functioning as usual. Fix The required assembly is missing when using the Calculated Agent v1.65 with an older Stream Host. When an Agent and the Stream Host supply the same assembly, the correct one is selected. In addition, detailed debug information is now logged when loading agent assemblies to better troubleshoot Agent and Stream Host issues.

A few Data Streams in the Agent Usage Details Report have blank names and an owner \"Unknown User\". The standard reports work as expected for Agents that predate the IPolling Interface. Fix I want to see the Event Simulator Agent on the Agent Polling Interval Report. Even though it is not a Listener or Context Provider, the frequency of the events generated has an impact on performance. The Event Simulator Agent is included in the Agent Polling Interval Report.

    "summary": "Agent FAQs Frequently asked questions regarding Agents. Are Agents thread-safe when running in a Data Stream? Yes, Agents are thread-safe. Each Stream Object (an Agent added to a Data Stream), including multiple instances of the same Agent, is an independent entity. How do Agents process events? Each Stream Object (an Agent added to a Data Stream) has its own thread-safe incoming event queue and processing thread. They receive events via input their endpoints according to the arrows added in the Data Stream. Further Reading Agent Endpoints Can Agents influence each other outside of the regular publish/subscribe mechanism? While Agents are designed to communicate only through the arrows, there are potential ways they might interact: Shared global variables (as the current Stream Host runs streams in a single process) Network communications Indirect effects, such as: One agent consuming excessive CPU processing power Multiple Agents making conflicting use of a shared resource (e.g., a physical device) Multiple Agents using the same shared library in a non-thread-safe manner What is a Stream Host? A Stream Host is the environment in which Data Streams run. It manages the execution of multiple Stream Objects within a single process. Further Reading Collection and Stream Host What are Arrows in the context of XMPro? Arrows are the links between Stream Object endpoints in a Data Stream. They represent the pathways through which Stream Objects pass data to each other. Further Reading Adding an Agent to the Canvas Input Mapping and Arrow Configuration What is a Data Stream? A Data Stream is a visual display of data flow, where the flow is represented by Stream Objects connected by arrows that perform actions on the data in real-time. Further Reading Data Stream Do Agents have memory buffers, and how do they work? Yes, each Agent has a memory buffer for events to be processed. This buffer is part of the Agent's thread-safe incoming event queue. Important characteristics of these buffers include: Fixed size: The buffer has a predetermined capacity to prevent excessive memory consumption on Stream Host devices, especially in cases of misconfigured data streams. Overflow behavior: When an agent's buffer is full, new incoming events will not be processed. This can lead to data loss if the incoming data rate consistently exceeds the agent's processing rate. Configuration considerations: It's crucial to properly configure data streams and monitor agent performance to ensure that buffer overflow situations are minimized, maintaining efficient data processing.

How do I change it?\" The Date Selector date display format is based on the browser display language, not your computer's local settings. For example: When the browser display language is set to English (Australia), the date format will be DD/MM/YYYY. When the browser display language is set to English (United States), the format will be MM/DD/YYYY. You should adjust your browser's display language settings - rather than your computer's local settings - to change the date format in XMPro. Data Stream Designer Can I use an older version of an Agent in a Data Stream? \"I'm copying the same pattern used in another Data Stream and I want to use the same version of a specific Agent (v2.7) when a newer version is available (v2.8).\" No, using an older version of an Agent when a newer version is available is not possible. The latest Agent should incorporate all of the functionalities of the previous version as well as any further modifications made. However, you could clone the original Data Stream and choose not to upgrade the Agent to the latest version. Further Reading Cloning Upgrade a Stream Object Version How do I view errors on my Stream Host? In the video below, we demonstrate how to view the log for a particular Stream Host in a Collection. The log contains errors encountered when publishing or running a Data Stream. Further Reading Stream Host Logs How to check Data Stream Logs How are the Stream Load Metrics calculated? \"I'm trying to reconcile the Stream Load metric in Data Stream designer with what I'm expecting based on the listeners. Is the metric calculated on the stream outputs or the inputs? I have 3 listeners, each running at a 1 second interval, so I expect a 180/min metric. Is the ~360/min metric because there are double the number of outputs (action agents) per listener?\" Stream load is different from ingestion rate. The Stream load represents the total number of events published by all Stream Objects on the canvas. In this case, 60 x the total number of agents on the screen (assuming your Listeners bring back 1 record on every poll). You would notice the actual number is much less because although you want it to run every second, the calls to dependencies like SQL etc do not return its data as quickly and hence the actual rate is less. Generally, the number of events published per Agent decreases as you work through your data stream, because the intention is to work towards a smaller payload focused on the event in which you're interested. Can I use more than one Run Recommendation Agent in a Data Stream? We advise you to only have one recommendation agent on a data stream. A recommendation rule is configured against a single Data Stream, not a given Stream Object in a Stream. It will find the first Run Recommendation in the selected Data Stream and let you define your Recommendation Rule against the output payload of that Agent. If the payload differs at runtime, you may get weird results when triggering a recommendation alert. If the data cannot be merged (using a join or union transformation) and used in the different recommendations, then consider creating 3 different data streams. Remember you can have one data stream feed data to as many recommendations as you want to, BUT you should only have one run recommendation agent on a data stream canvas. My Data Stream Connector can do everything. Why use the other Connectors? Although a wide variety of data can be surfaced from a Data Stream into your Application using the Data Stream Connector, there is a downside. The Data Stream is constantly pushing data, which can lead to out-of-resource errors - which appear as XMPro product errors. If your data requirement is ad-hoc, consider the other Connectors. Further Reading List of App Designer Connectors Connector I've added a new recommendation - why can't I see the triggered alerts in the recommendation grid view?

It is broken down into 17 lessons - totaling 7 hours - covering an overview, Data Stream Designer, Recommendations, and App Designer. You can also find an extensive array of YouTube videos on various topics of interest on our YouTube channel XMPro learning. Are there any prerequisites for the training? As XMPro is a no-code platform, there are no technical prerequisites. We do recommend the following to make your training more effective: Start with a Use Case/problem statement in mind Have access to an XMPro instance so you can practice and work out issues Session Timeout How does the XMPro sign-in process work? When you try to sign in to XMPro Data Stream Designer or App Designer, you're redirected to the linked XMPro Subscription Manager's sign-in page. Enter your username and password to log in. Upon signing in, you receive credentials as browser cookies for both Subscription Manager and the site you wish to access. Subscription Manager redirects you back to the requested site, granting you an access token using those cookie credentials. The access token is valid for the duration specified in the site's Session Timeout setting, while cookies last for longer periods (e.g., an hour). Cookies enable access to the website's pages and assets like JavaScript and images, while the access token allows you to access the site's data, which is essential for activities like navigating, viewing live updates on app pages and saving changes. Note The Session Timeout setting is accessible by the Site Admin and can be found in Subscription Manager under the details blade for the product (e.g., App Designer). How long do I stay signed in? Without \"Remember Me\": you stay signed in for 1 hour or until your browser session ends (e.g. closing the browser window). With \"Remember Me\": you stay signed in for 30 days or until the site is unable to silently refresh the credentials. Note The Remember Me checkbox can be found when signing into XMPro. How does the Silent Refresh functionality work? When using XMPro App Designer, Data Stream Designer, or Subscription Manager, the site attempts a silent refresh of the credentials as the access token nears its expiry time. If successful, a new token is granted, valid for the duration specified in the Session Timeout setting. If unsuccessful, the site displays a login expired warning with a prompt to sign in again. Clicking the button redirects you to Subscription Manager for credentials. If the Subscription Manager cookie is still valid, it automatically issues a new access token and redirects back to the original site; otherwise, you're prompted to sign in again. Successful attempts through either path will refresh the cookie credentials if they're nearing expiry and meet refresh conditions. Refreshing the page will also update the credentials. Versioning What version of XMPro am I using? Whether you are logging a support issue or looking for a specific product feature, knowing the version of the XMPro Platform you're using is important. Click the help icon top right of the web applications to view the help blade. It contains the version number as well as helpful links such as release notes and logging a support ticket. From v4.4.4 onwards, you can access more details in the following ways: For web applications only, check the /version endpoint, which produces a response such as... { \"ApplicationTitle\": \"XMPro App Designer\", \"XMProPlatformVersion\": \"4.4.4\", \"InformationalVersion\": \"4.4.4.28+8c9912b045\", \"GitCommitId\": \"8c9912b04592ac2d54bf4fa9a522203cbd21bc98\", \"GitCommitDate\": \"2024-05-10T04:41:02Z\" } For all applications, check the log files.

XMPro strongly recommends that all projects should have a defined ROI. Therefore the initial Use Cases, collection of data pertaining to the Business Problems that you are seeking to resolve, and evaluation of project outcome at the midpoint and project close are vital to substantiate the ROI. A synopsis of our framework for a project is as follows: Define the Business Problem that needs to be addressed Identify Bad Actors Care must be taken to identify the initial Use Case Refer McKinsey study 4 steps on page 12 Refer McKinsey study Avoid Pilot Purgatory Gather data for the initial Proof of Value or Pilot Commence Proof of Value or Pilot Hold a mid-point review & measure success against these questions Does the tool work? Does it deliver value? Would the customer use it? Collect the ROI achieved in the Pilot Period Project Gate = Go / No Go decision To build a Digital Twin of a factory, do I start with the whole factory or start small? Always start small. Digital transformation is achieved by many small projects that lock in success at each step. The overall goal is to achieve project success early and expand. There will be many challenges for you to achieve success, by starting with small projects you lower the overall risk of failure. The positive flip side of small projects is that you fail fast, and the costs are limited. I want Predictive Maintenance, and I want it now. We think it makes sense to think of two components of PdM (Predictive Maintenance): First Principle / Engineering Models – The starting point for most predictive solutions supported by real-time sensor data AI / Statistical Models – Use the AI / Statistical models to augment decision support but requires quality data and contextual models Subject to quality data, the First Principle / Engineering Models are the fast start as the formula is agreed upon and the model is ready to go. AI / Statistical Models require more effort and analysis – one will need the assets failure history and time and resources to refine your models. Another view of your predictive maintenance goal is to consider the maturity of the use cases. Smart Asset Management includes the smart use of condition monitoring, predictive maintenance, and process optimization. What is XMPro's approach to AI? XMPro is not an AI company. We can call the AI / Statistical models and use the output to trigger recommendation alerts, but the models are sourced from you or one of our AI partners. How does XMPro do it? We provide integration building blocks in our Data Streams to call the model and use the model output for computation of the real-time data stream, which is used in the creation of a recommendation for the asset. XMPro has the capability to pass data to Azure Machine Learning and train models. These models can be called by other XMPro Data Streams to use the model output for evaluation of real-time streaming data. For example, the RUL of a Secondary Crusher. Further Reading How to work with Data Streams Python Integration Azure ML Integration I've seen Mining examples. Can XMPro compose a Digital Twin for utilities? Yes, we can. In 2021/22 XMPro predominantly worked in the Mining and Oil & Gas sectors, and we are now expanding to other asset-intensive industries such as Utilities and Chemicals. These asset-intensive industries all have similar equipment, challenges, and use cases. We find that we can transport solutions from one to the other in these industries. The lessons learned from Mining can accelerate solutions for Utilities, bringing a slightly different perspective on how to approach challenges from a \"bad actor\" and failure analysis point of view rather than a traditional \"similar industry\" approach. Below is our strategy for expansion in asset-intensive industries with transferable use cases around asset availability problems. Architecture Can XMPro be installed and used on-premise? Yes. Currently, the majority of XMPro deployments are Cloud-based. XMPro can be deployed on-premises, on Azure/AWS, or as a hybrid with parts on-premises and in the cloud. Typically for the hybrid deployment, the stream host is deployed on-premises with the core application being hosted on the cloud. On-premise deployments have been driven by the need for remote locations, as well as constraints on internet access from within a corporate network. Further Reading On-Premise deployment All deployment options If XMPro is in the Cloud, can I connect to my On-Premise application(s)? Yes. If your applications are internet-facing, then a cloud stream host can be used. If your applications are behind a firewall and internal to your network, then in this instance XMPro will be a hybrid deployment model, with the stream host located on-premises. Further Reading Azure Deployment Diagram AWS Deployment Diagram Do I need a separate server for the stream host, or will it run on the same application server? The preferred approach is to have a separate infrastructure for the stream host. It is possible that your XMPro deployment has only one Stream Host. However, this is rarely the case and we suggest the following considerations: Consider each location having a dedicated Stream Host A critical Data Stream, like pressure readings on a pressure vessel, may have its own dedicated Stream Host If a payload for a Data Stream is large and frequent, then consider a dedicated Stream Host for that Data Stream. Having several Stream Hosts can improve the resilience of your system Network latency and geographical spread could be factors in considering the case for multiple Stream Hosts Performance A look beneath the hood of XMPro Charts and Time Series Analysis Charts Often the first time that users are aware of the components that make up XMPro charts is when they experience slow rendering times. This article seeks to explain the structure behind the XMPro charts and the components that impact chart performance. Performance is not limited to the Time Series Analysis as the same pattern pertains to other XMPro charts too, such as the Chart Block. With an understanding of the influences on chart performance, the reader will be in an informed position to address their requirement. The current Time Series Analysis use SQL and Azure ADX as data sources. XMPro as an Event Intelligence platform XMPro is purpose-built to manage events in real-time. This means its technologies can be used for Business Intelligence purposes. The processing of large swathes of past time series data is possible, but there are circumstances where this will not be an optimal user experience as the connectors work on the basis of 'Get All Data' and not incremental steps like for example, Grafana. XMPro App Designer Server memory scenarios The XMPro App Designer Server will reserve the required memory for each unique query while there is at least 1 active user interacting with it. A unique query is defined as a Time Series Chart instance, with the same date selection and same data source. The number of concurrent queries with at least 1 active user will have an influence on the XMPro App Designer Server performance. If one user runs a query that consumes 2 GB of server memory and a different user performs that same query, then the server consumes no additional memory and instead used the cached query. If a different query is run that consumes 4 GB of server memory, then a total of 6 GB of memory would be consumed, and so on. Depending on the server configuration this could impact overall server performance and response time (user experience).\" Settings that could impact performance There are several influences on XMPro App Designer Server and XMPro App Designer Client performance. The main influences would include: Web Server memory Web Server CPU Load balancing / Auto Scaling (scale out) Data Size (size and number of rows) Data Complexity (type and relationship of data) Where aggregation is performed (Data Layer vs Web Server vs Chart Control) Network speed and reliability (Data Layer, Web Server, and Client Browser) Client Available CPU speed Client Available Memory Web Browser and Version XMPro Platform Version SQL vs ADX The first consideration that impacts response time is the amount of data queried at the data source and the volume of data transmitted in response. The second consideration is the volume and complexity of data that the App Designer Server needs to parse. Figures 1 & 2 illustrate the reason for the improved performance of ADX over SQL. Amending the aggregation period will be almost instantaneous on ADX. On SQL this is likely to be slower. Issues for consideration to address overall performance The Time Series Analysis data loads initially and then again whenever the date selection is changed. Thus the initial selection should be limited, e.g. 3 hours. The appropriate initial selection depends upon the frequency of data points, i.e., if the time interval is every second, every minute, or every hour. The number of assets affects performance - not whether they are selected. All data points for all assets for the data range selection are loaded so that the query does not need to be reloaded when a user changes their asset selection. Limit the number of records fetched from the source system, either by using aggregation at the source if possible (or) by limiting to a shorter date range selection. Consider whether this is tracking events in real-time or requires discovery in a BI environment. Consider the number of simultaneous users and unique query combinations and whether sufficient resources have been allocated.

    "summary": "Performant Landing Pages in Real-Time Monitoring XMPro Design Patterns, Published Mar 2025 Performant Landing Pages v1.0.pdf Problem Statement A poorly performing landing page creates frustrated, disconnected users. Imagine waiting for data to load, knowing it won't tell you what you need to know – so you'll have to change a filter or navigate elsewhere and wait all over again! One reason for a poor landing page is if it is loaded up with a Unity 3D model of a beautiful long-haul truck or wind farm. Seeing a Caterpillar truck in 3D with real-time sensor readings and alerts is a thing of beauty, but do you need to see it 1st time every time? This is the question for page designers who may confuse 'sizzle' with a real-life working dashboard. The usefulness of the page balanced with performance should be top of mind. \"What is the problem the user is seeking to answer\" should drive every component of every page. Introduction Landing page design requires a balanced approach that addresses both technical performance and user experience needs. Successful implementation depends on recognizing that these dimensions are interconnected—technical decisions directly shape how users interact with and perceive XMPro applications. In industrial environments, landing pages serve operational personnel who require immediate access to actionable information. The effectiveness of these pages directly impacts decision-making processes, situational awareness, and operational efficiency. Thus, technical implementation must align with specific operational contexts and user workflows. Key principles that connect technical implementation to user impact include: Performance directly shapes initial user perception - Load times establish immediate trust in the system and determine whether users engage effectively Data relevance is as important as data speed - Users need not just fast access, but immediate visibility of the specific information required for their role Interface design must balance visual clarity with resource efficiency - Technical optimization and intuitive design work together to guide users to essential functions Device context significantly affects both technical requirements and user needs - Implementation must account for varying operational environments and device capabilities Scale considerations affect both system architecture and user comprehension - As data volumes grow, adapt technical approaches and information presentation The following sections explore how these principles translate to specific implementation strategies across the key aspects of landing page design—balancing technical performance with meaningful user experiences. Performance & First Impressions Critical First Moments Initial page load performance establishes immediate user trust and engagement you're your XMPro industrial applications. Users form judgments about system reliability within milliseconds of their first interaction, making the technical optimization of landing pages a direct driver of user confidence and operational effectiveness. The \"time to first meaningful paint\"—when users first see and can interact with essential content—directly shapes their perception of the entire system. In industrial environments, this initial impression extends beyond mere satisfaction to affect operational readiness and decision-making capability. Make the user journey easy, fast and relevant. Performance Targets Landing pages must meet specific performance targets across different operational contexts: Fixed workstations and laptops: maximum 2 seconds Research shows user frustration begins at 2 seconds Enterprise infrastructure should support optimal performance Portable devices (tablets and phones) on 5G networks: maximum 3 seconds Field operations require rapid mobile access Enterprise security adds processing overhead These targets ensure that all users, regardless of their work environment, can immediately engage with critical operational data. Strategic Content Distribution Strategically distribute content across primary landing pages and drill-down views to optimize performance: Landing Page Essentials Include only critical metrics, alerts, and primary controls on initial landing pages (Data that matters) Focus on immediate visibility of essential operational indicators Utilize lightweight visualization components (tiles, simple charts, status indicators) Drill-down Resource Management Place resource-intensive visualizations (maps, Unity 3D models, complex dashboards) on separate drill-down pages, ensuring these elements load only when explicitly requested by users Provide clear visual indicators of what detailed information is available For example, a manufacturing operations landing page should immediately show critical KPIs and alert counts, with clear pathways to detailed floor visualizations that load only when selected. This approach ensures immediate access to essential information while preserving system responsiveness. Device-Specific Optimization Rather than a one-page-fits-all approach, each device category requires specific optimization approaches: Control Room Displays Optimized for large screens and multiple monitors Focused on comprehensive data visualization Designed for mouse and keyboard interaction Field Tablets Simplified interface for touch interaction Prioritized critical metrics for mobile viewing Adapted for variable lighting conditions Mobile Devices Streamlined for essential operational data Optimized for single-hand operation Designed for intermittent connectivity Note Summary: Performance optimization directly impacts first impressions and operational effectiveness Ensure landing pages load within device-specific target times Include only essential elements on initial landing pages Place resource-intensive visualizations on separate drill-down pages Adapt interface and content based on device context and user role Provide clear pathways to detailed information Data Strategy & Content Relevance Connecting Data Management with User Needs Data management and content prioritization work together to create effective landing pages. How we handle data directly affects what users see and how quickly they can access important information. Smart Data Architecture Choices Effective implementation requires careful consideration of data scope, storage location, and access patterns to achieve optimal response times. Consider these key architectural decisions: Data Volume Control Use focused data sets with clear time boundaries (like 30-day windows) Prioritize data that supports immediate operational decisions Provide clear paths to historical data when needed Storage Strategy Optimization Choose storage solutions based on access frequency and performance requirements Keep critical operational metrics in fast-access storage Balance query speed against storage costs (e.g. ADX vs SQL) For industrial applications, this means deciding which metrics need immediate visibility vs which can be accessed through drilldowns. For example, a plant manager's landing page might show current production rates and critical alerts, while detailed equipment metrics remain accessible through clear navigation options. Content Organization for Different Users XMPro landing pages must adapt content presentation based on both technical limits and user priorities: Role-Based Content Focus Show the most relevant information for each role immediately Adjust content organization based on device type and operational context Keep critical alerts and indicators visible regardless of device Structure information to support common decision workflows Adaptive Information Density Adjust information density based on device capabilities Present complex visualizations differently across device types Ensure important metrics remain prominent on all devices Provide consistent access to essential functions across all formats For example, when showing industrial processes on mobile devices, the system might display simplified status indicators with clear paths to detailed diagrams, while workstations receive more comprehensive initial visualizations. Data Currency Management Resource-intensive calculations and complex aggregations form the foundation of landing page metrics. However, daily sensor readings don't warrant hourly recalculation, while production metrics might require more frequent updates. Balancing data freshness with performance requires a strategic approach to updates: Scheduled Calculations Perform resource-intensive calculations during off-peak times Match refresh intervals to actual data change patterns Show clear timestamps indicating last calculation time Provide manual refresh capabilities for users Real-Time vs. Pre-Calculated Data Use pre-calculated metrics for landing page elements to improve load speed Reserve real-time queries for critical operational metrics and drill-down views Balance real-time capabilities with system performance Clearly indicate which metrics are real-time versus aggregated summaries The goal is to provide rapid access to summarized metrics while enabling detailed exploration of current data. The currency data should always be displayed for each component. Note Summary: Effective data strategy connects technical performance with operational relevance Match data scope and access methods to specific operational roles Prioritize content based on device context and user responsibilities Implement appropriate data currency strategies for different metric types Structure information to support operational decision-making Balance information density with clarity across all device types Interface Design & User Navigation Integrating Design Structure with User Interaction Pathways Interface architecture and user navigation function as interconnected systems that determine operational efficiency. Research-based design principles support efficient information access while enabling critical industrial functions[1]. Effective integration of these components creates landing pages that guide users naturally through their workflows. Layout Optimization User interaction research reveals that effective landing page design must strategically position elements to align with natural viewing patterns and business objectives. The dominant F-pattern[2] scanning behavior shows users first view the top-left area, then scan horizontally before moving downward. This research provides clear guidance for element placement. Critical Component Positioning Position critical metrics and status indicators in the top-left quadrant, for immediate visibility Structure navigation elements to start key processes, reducing cognitive load Organize visual elements by usage frequency and business priority - following the natural F-pattern scanning path In industrial control interfaces, this evidence-based approach to layout design directly impacts user engagement and task completion rates across all device formats. Visualization Strategy Implementation Component selection is a tradeoff between system performance and user engagement. While simpler visualizations deliver better performance, they may reduce user insight and satisfaction; conversely, sophisticated visualizations that delight users often impose significant performance costs. Effective visualization requires balancing these competing demands. Component Selection Parameters Choose visualization types based on data volume, update frequency, and performance impact Reserve resource-intensive components (maps, time series, Unity models) for drill-down views, i.e. requested by a user rather than automatically loaded Utilize efficient components (charts, grids, tiles) for primary metrics display Adapt visualization complexity inversely to data volume (simpler views for larger datasets) For example, when displaying sensor data across multiple sites, consider using a simplified grid view for the landing page rather than an interactive map visualization. These more complex visualizations should load when specifically requested, preserving system responsiveness while maintaining access to detailed information. Clear Action Pathways Conversion path clarity in effective landing pages ensures that primary user actions remain clear and accessible across devices. users can efficiently navigate to primary actions across all devices. Call-to-Action (CTA) elements require careful design consideration to maintain their prominence and effectiveness regardless of display context. This aspect of interface design supports operational effectiveness by minimizing cognitive effort during task execution. Action Element Consistency Maintain consistent CTA visibility across all device types Adapt interactive element sizes to device input methods Optimize touch targets for mobile and tablet interfaces In practical implementation, an \"Overdue Recommendations\" function might span the full width on mobile screens for easy touch access, while appearing as a compact button in a consistent location on desktop interfaces. Although the appearance adapts, the function and its importance remain clear to users regardless of device. Note Summary: Effective interface design integrates layout principles with navigation pathways Position key elements according to validated visual scanning patterns Select visualization components based on performance and usability requirements Design clear interaction paths for essential operational functions Preserve visual hierarchy across different screen sizes [1] https://www.finoit.com/articles/maximizing-user-experience-design-through-information-architecture/ [2] LinkedIn: Understanding and Leveraging the F-Pattern in UX Design Operational Context Adaptation Content Prioritization Across Devices How information is structured and presented must adapt to different screen sizes while maintaining operational relevance. Content prioritization ensures critical information remains accessible regardless of viewing context. Device-Specific Content Hierarchy Adapt content structure based on device constraints and operational context Maintain critical alert visibility across all form factors Implement progressive disclosure for complex information sets Provide clear paths to detailed information On smaller devices, complex features like process diagrams or digital twin demonstrations should be simplified initially, with clear options to access detailed views. This approach preserves XMPro's industrial process capabilities while adapting to device constraints, ensuring the strong value proposition is maintained without overwhelming users. Device-Specific Implementation Strategies Different operational environments demand tailored interface approaches while maintaining functional consistency. Understanding how each device type is used in industrial contexts shapes implementation decisions. Control Room Environments Design for extended monitoring sessions with comprehensive information display Support advanced interactions using precision input devices Enable systematic comparison between related process parameters Optimize for continuous operational oversight Field Operations Support Prioritize glance-based information access for mobile contexts Provide simplified status indicators with clear paths to details Design for variable environmental conditions (lighting, distractions) Optimize for potentially intermittent connectivity Cross-Device Integration Ensure users maintain consistent mental models across devices Preserve work state during device transitions Implement unified notification systems across all platforms Support seamless operational continuity regardless of access point Note Summary: Operational context variations necessitate adaptation while preserving core functionality Prioritize content based on device context and operational roles Implement device-specific interfaces while maintaining consistent functionality Ensure device choice never impedes operational workflows Scale Considerations System scale fundamentally impacts implementation decisions across data architecture and visualization strategies. Each order of magnitude (10^4, 10^6, and 10^8) presents distinct optimization requirements that affect both performance and user experience. Landing page design must anticipate and adapt to these scale transitions to maintain effective operation. In industrial environments, scale considerations directly impact implementation choices. For example, a dashboard displaying real-time sensor data might use detailed line graphs when monitoring ten devices but must switch to aggregated heat maps when tracking thousands of sensors. Similarly, a landing page designed for a single manufacturing site requires different optimization strategies than one managing global operations. As noted by Peter van Hardenberg, increasing scale changes everything about a system - from data architecture to visualizations. Rather than attempting to design for all scale possibilities, implementations should target specific scale ranges and plan for transitions as operational needs evolve. Note Summary: Key principles for managing scale Match implementation to current operational requirements Implement appropriate data aggregation methods Select visualization techniques suitable for data volume Design and test at production-equivalent scale Plan system rebuilds at major scale transition points (10^4, 10^6, 10^8) Avoid over-engineering for future scale requirements Implement appropriate monitoring for scale-related performance metrics Conclusion Successful landing page implementation in industrial environments requires careful balance across multiple dimensions: performance requirements, data architecture, and user experience. Key success metrics include initial load time performance, data currency management, and operational workflow efficiency. These metrics must be evaluated within the context of device-specific requirements and scale considerations. Implementation teams should focus on delivering robust core functionality that meets essential operational needs. This approach aligns with industrial reliability requirements, where consistent performance takes precedence over non-essential features. As with choosing between a Toyota Corolla and a Tesla, the goal is to match implementation complexity to actual requirements - sometimes reliability and simplicity are key, while other situations may warrant more sophisticated solutions.

It involves analyzing and implementing ways for users to navigate through digital platforms efficiently, which directly impacts operational efficiency[2]. Research-based design principles, like user-centered design and iterative testing, ensure that navigation systems are intuitive and easy to use. Information Architecture Principles: Dan Brown's 10 principles of information architecture provide a comprehensive framework for designing user-friendly information systems. Principles like \"Focused Navigation\" and \"Multiple Classifications\" help ensure that users can access information efficiently, which is essential for operational efficiency[3]. These principles support the idea that well-structured information architectures enable critical functions by making information accessible and organized. Best Practices in Navigation and Information Architecture: Best practices in UX/UI design emphasize the importance of intuitive menus and navigation systems. These systems are fundamental in helping users explore and navigate through digital interfaces, which is critical for guiding users through workflows[4]. Effective organization of information and visual hierarchy are key considerations for ensuring that users can easily find what they need, thereby enhancing operational efficiency. Landing Page Design: While the statement specifically mentions landing pages, effective landing page design often incorporates principles of navigation and information architecture. For example, landing pages like those of Workable and Trello use minimalistic designs and intuitive navigation to guide users through workflows efficiently[5]. These designs are based on understanding the target audience's needs and behaviors, which aligns with research-based design principles. In summary, the integration of interface architecture and user navigation is supported by research-based design principles that enhance operational efficiency and support critical industrial functions. Effective navigation and information architecture are crucial for creating seamless user experiences and guiding users naturally through workflows, including landing pages.

It is suggested that new users of XMPro should workshop their requirements with their XMPro partners. It is useful to emphasise that XMPro is an Intelligent Business Operations Solution (iBOS). Introduction This document has arisen from the work done with partners and seeks to align some APM capabilities pertaining to Recommendation Alert Management with XMPro configurations based on standard XMPro capability. For ease of use we have labelled those configurations 'Design Patterns\". We call these patterns 'Composable Business Capabilities'. (CBC[1]) The customer will need to adapt the design pattern to their own situation. Some of the Design Patterns have been further developed and are available as Apps in our GitHub[2] – these are enabled 'Packaged Business Capabilities' (PBC)[3].

Design patterns can be used to further enhance the systems capability. Unified view The APM system will provide a unified view of the reliability health and risk scores through integration of asset strategy, condition monitoring, analytics, and APM data systems to measure cost, failure rates and compliance metrics. Priority The APM system will provide a standard process for defining the criticality of assets. The APM system will provide a standard process for defining the Risk Priority Number (RPN) / severity score of recommendation alerts. The APM system will provide a standard process for prioritising recommendation alerts by the measure of an alert's Risk Priority Number (RPN) and an asset criticality score. The APM system will provide a modifiable risk matrix that can be adjusted to the company's definition of risk. Recommendation management The APM system will provide the ability to create recommendations within each area of functionality that can be associated to an equipment ID or functional location. The APM system will provide means to track and follow up recommendations from several hierarchical levels perspective in the organization (site, areas, units, system, and assets). The APM system can provide the ability to schedule an alert email message to be sent to the person responsible for ensuring that the recommendation is addressed. The APM system will provide concise reporting and alerting capability to track outstanding and past-due recommendations. The APM system will provide the ability to initiate recommendations for further planning and execution. 2. Management of Recommendation Alerts during Shutdowns The Shutdown Management App uses the State and Observer Patterns to manage preplanned shutdowns effectively. During a shutdown, the app transitions assets to a \"Disabled\" state using the State Pattern, silencing recommendations and preventing the creation of equipment alerts based on anomalies. The Observer Pattern ensures stakeholders are notified about the shutdown schedule via email, enhancing communication and coordination. This approach maintains system integrity and operational efficiency by ensuring that no unnecessary alerts are generated during maintenance periods. APM capability Capability to suspend alerts during a Shutdown process. Associated Design Pattern Shutdown – Object, Observer patterns APM requirements A number of the requirements are addressed out of the box. However, the design patterns can be used to enhance the systems capability. The APM system will provide the capability to automatically suspend generate alerts during a planned shutdown / start up. The APM system will provide the capability to amend planned shutdown and startup times for a planned shutdown / start up. The APM system will optionally categorize, and store alerts generated during the shutdown and start up procedures. 3.

The APM system will provide integration to a maintenance management / paper free work order process. 4. Categorization of Recommendation Alerts A Recommendation Meta Tag App uses the Decorator Pattern to dynamically enhance asset data without altering the original schema. By assigning meta tags such as performance metrics, maintenance recommendations, and operational statuses to assets, the app enriches contextual data, enabling more informed decision-making. This approach allows for flexible and scalable data enhancement, improving predictive maintenance, performance monitoring, and overall asset management within the APM framework.

However, the design patterns can be used to enhance the systems capability.

Categorization of Assets An Asset Master Hierarchy App utilizes the Decorator Pattern to dynamically enhance the hierarchical representation of assets without altering the original asset structure. This app assigns hierarchical meta tags, such as parent-child relationships, asset dependencies, and location mappings to assets, for more informed decision-making. APM capability Asset hierarchy will cater for user defined categorization. Asset hierarchy capability within the system and not rely on the historian asset hierarchies.

However, design patterns can be used to enhance the systems capability. Recommendation management The APM system will provide the capability to filter and categorize assets. The APM system will provide the capability to allocate a criticality score to each asset. Part 2: XMPro configurations as Design Patterns This section articulates how using XMPro capabilities the APM requirement is addressed. This assembly of configured XMPro capability is the foundation for a low code XMPro App. The authors have used standard XMPro functionality to create the various Design patterns. This Practice Note is primarily concerned with a unified view of prioritized Recommendation Alerts. The most popular Design Pattern is definitely 'Work Bench', but we recommend that the other Design Patterns should be reviewed and considered. 1. Design Pattern: Work Bench The objective of the Recommendation Alerts Workbench design pattern is to allow for the prioritization, categorization and filtering of alerts. The workbench addresses the following APM capabilities: Unified view of Recommendation Alerts, reliability health and risk scores Asset and alert rating Asset criticality Recommendation severity Recommendation alert priority Recommendation alert management Priority map of asset criticality Generic querying, reporting, graphing, and searching capabilities for all asset types, alert histories, and work orders. Users have a high-level unified view to assist in their workflow process by providing the ability to see XMPro alerts filtered by criticality and status as well as associated WO's. In the above example the first three tabs focus on the status of Recommendation Alerts – Open, Assigned without WO and Assigned with WO. The landing page alert tabs will include all unassigned alerts. The last three tabs focus on linked WO and the appropriate status; Open, Complete WO and Closed WO. The filtering, tabs, actions, and various status would be set for your circumstance. The aim is to give the user situational awareness to all the elements of the Recommendation Alert. The above example page provides the relevant information on an alert to allow users to: See a holistic view of a piece of equipment (ability to see all alerts related to that asset) Any associated discussion which may provide insights into investigation and actions take Data at time of alert triggering Relevant metrics (schematics, score history) In the Figure 3 this shows an example of assigning many Alerts to one WO. This page shows all open work orders and associated Recommendation Alerts. Additionally, users can create custom recommendation pages which display relevant data to the alert including: Other alerts associated with the Asset ID Metadata associated with the alert Ability to tie a WO/WR to the alert All WO/WR available 2. Design Pattern: Asset Prioritization Asset Prioritization= (Severity (Recommendation Alert Setting) X Occurrence X Detectability) X Asset Criticality settings (assigned at Asset level). Severity set at Recommendation level with Recommendation Category factor, Recommendation Factor and Recommendation Rule Factor. Occurrence is measured in the Data Stream and updated with the 'Run Recommendation' agent. Note: For calculating Occurrences with tags, log on all occurrences should be enabled for your recommendations Occurrence can be calculated with two methods which is based on the data. A) Event Frames B) Tags Refer to Appendix A Note An occurrence may not necessarily correspond to a new Recommendation Alert. For example, when polling OSI PI tags, the current occurrence might be part of an existing fault that previously triggered an open Recommendation Alert, or it could trigger a new alert if none is currently open. In such cases, an occurrence count is used to indicate the number of polling intervals during which the alert logic is met. Conversely, if the Data Stream is ingesting OSI Event Frames (EF), then each new EF is treated as a separate occurrence. This distinction is vital for accurately defining the measure for occurrence count. Detectability is omitted as we assume that the Failure Mode is detectable if a recommendation rule exists. Default score = 1 Asset Criticality is assigned at an Asset level in the Asset Master, Asset Hierarchy or Asset meta tags. Ideally, this is pulled from a source system to match the existing criticalities you are utilizing for other reliability activities. If this is unavailable, this can be stored in XMPro. XMPro capability on Recommendation scoring [4]. Note We suggest the initial default values be 1. We would expect that there will be several cycles as the various score settings are fine tuned. [4] How is the scoring calculated 3. Design Pattern: Asset Shutdown The purpose of the app is to allow users to silence alert generation for specific assets in recommendations while still maintaining the published state of the recommendation. This activation/deactivation will take place automatically based on predefined start/stop dates. The application will also notify users when the shutdown will start and end to determine if a modification is necessary and as a verification step. In the examples below we have explained the concept detailing a shutdown by asset. However, we strongly suggest that the first iteration allows for shutdown by a level in the asset hierarchy or some other mechanism the sites may have. Example you may wish to shut assets within a certain location. If your organization analyses Recommendation Alerts across the organization, the analysis is not clouded by the need to omit alerts triggered during a shutdown and the subsequent start up. This page will be used to create new shutdowns and edit existing shutdowns. For existing shutdowns, assigned assets will appear below the shutdown grid. This page will be used to assign Assets to an existing shutdown. The \"Previously Selected\" column tells shutdown planners what Assets are already assigned to a shutdown. 4. Design Pattern: Recommendation Meta Tags Administration The Recommendation Meta Tag Application enriches asset data by dynamically adding meta tags with maintenance recommendations, operational statuses, and performance metrics. This contextual information aids in making informed maintenance decisions and optimizing asset performance. By enhancing data without altering the original asset schema, the application supports predictive maintenance and improves overall asset management, leading to increased operational efficiency and reliability. In this page we have opted to distinguish between 'Not Allocated', or 'Not Reviewed'. 'Not Allocated' means that the Meta Tag is not relevant to the Recommendation (In the above this is the preferred allocation as not blank) and 'Not Reviewed' means that no selection has been decided for this asset. In the page above we have assigned Meta Tag Values to a Recommendation. This page creates or edits the Meta Tag Values. The Meta Tag column will populate a dropdown of existing options from the list of available options Created on the Meta Tags page. This page contains a grid where the user can create or edit the Meta Tags. 5. Design Pattern: Asset Meta Tags Administration The Asset Meta Tag Application enhances asset management by dynamically adding meta tags to asset data. These tags include performance metrics, maintenance recommendations, and operational statuses, providing enriched contextual information. This additional data helps in predictive maintenance, performance monitoring, and informed decision-making without altering the original asset schema. The application enables better tracking and management of assets, leading to improved operational efficiency and reliability. In this page we have opted to distinguish between 'Not Allocated', or 'Not Reviewed'. 'Not Allocated' means that the Meta Tag is not relevant to the Asset (A preferred allocation rather than blank) and 'Not Reviewed' means that no selection has been made for this asset. This page will be used to assign Meta Tag Values to an Asset. Each Meta Tag will populate a row with the corresponding Meta Tag Values for selection from the dropdown. This page contains a grid where the user can create or edit the Meta Tag Values. The Meta Tag column will populate a dropdown of existing options from the list of available options Created on the Meta Tags page. This page contains a grid where the user can create or edit the Meta Tags. Appendix 1 – Calculation of Recommendation Alert and Asset Priority Scores Definitions Term Description Asset Criticality Score Asset Criticality is a value (1-10) you set for your site assets based on how critical those site assets are to you. A value of 1 indicates the lowest level of importance, while a value of 10 is absolutely critical to your company. Asset Criticality is assigned at an Asset level in the Asset Master, Asset Hierarchy, or Asset meta tags. Asset Priority Score Asset Criticality * Weighted Risk Priority Number for all applicable Recommendation Alerts Recommendation Alert Priority Score Risk Priority Number * Asset Criticality Risk Priority Number (RPN) Severity * Detectability * Occurrence Severity The severity of the failure mode is rated on a scale from 1 (low) to 1000 (high). A high severity rating indicates severe risk. Recommendation Category Factor * Recommendation Factor * Recommendation Rule Factor. Detectability Set at 1 as all asset conditions measured are detectable Occurrence The logarithmic function Frequency = 1/a * logb(mx) + c to measuring operational alarms in a system. 1. Approach to Scoring Occurrence for an individual Recommendation Alert 1.1 Event Frames (Logarithmic Formula) Event Frames monitor all occurrences unlike the Recommendation Alerts where the occurrence is measured at the polling. Consequently, a Recommendation Alert does not equal all occurrences. Outcome – Recommendation Alert Priority Score Formula: \\(Recommendation Alert Priority Score = (Severity * Occurrence* X Detectability) * Asset Criticality settings (assigned at Asset level)\\) Severity & Detectability as stated in 'Definitions' above. Occurrence is a measure of the count that the recommendation logic is met. We use the logarithmic function to calculate 'Occurrence'. The logarithmic function to measuring operational alarms in a system. \\(Occurance= 1/a* 〖log〗_b (mx)+c\\) Where: x is the number of alerts for that specific alert type a is a scaling factor m is the multiplier for x c is a vertical shift Examples for each constant: x: Number of alerts in the last x hours [x is a global parameter] Let's say x = 100 alerts were recorded in the past 24 hours. a: Scaling factor for the overall frequency Example: a = 0.5 A smaller value of 'a' will increase the overall frequency, making the system more sensitive to changes in the number of alerts. b: Base of the logarithm Example: b = 10 Using base 10 is common and makes the scale easy to interpret. Each order of magnitude increase in alerts will correspond to a unit increase in the log value. m: Multiplier for x (alert count) Example: m = 0.1 This scales down the number of alerts. If m < 1, it reduces the impact of large numbers of alerts, preventing the frequency from growing too quickly. c: Vertical shift Example: c = 3 This adds a constant to the result, effectively setting a minimum frequency even when there are very few alerts. The logarithmic function helps to compress the range of occurrence values, preventing the RPN from growing too quickly for assets with very frequent alerts. Adjusting the parameters a, b, m, and c allows you to fine-tune the sensitivity of the occurrence calculation to best fit your risk assessment needs. The formula can be enhanced to incorporate multiple variables. Example for a pump \\(1/a * logb(mx * V * T * F * E) + c\\) Where: x = number of alerts in the last 24 hours V = vibration level factor T = temperature factor F = flow rate factor E = efficiency metric factor 1.2 Tags (Using time decay) In the situation where Recommendation Alerts are created from polling asset tags, we normalize the occurrence count with a time decay function. \\[ Recommendation Alert Priority Score = (Severity * Occurrence* X Detectability) * Asset Criticality settings (assigned at Asset level) \\] Severity & Detectability as stated in 'Definitions' above. Occurrence is a measure of the count that the recommendation logic is met. This approach accounts for two factors: The gradual decrease in an alert's significance over time The varying sampling frequencies across different data sources. The resulting score reflects both the event's severity and its temporal relevance. The following equation can be used: \\(Occurrence= n* e ^ (-λt)\\) Where: \\(λ\\) is the decay rate \\(t\\) is the duration from the current time \\(n\\) is percentage of time an alert was open normalized To calculate \\(n\\), use the following ratio \\[ n=(Actual number of Occurrence for a duration)/(Total Potential Occurance in that duration) \\] For example, we have two alerts open. Alert 1: \\(λ\\) is .01 \\(t\\) is every 24 hours \\(n\\) is percentage of time an alert was open normalized Polling Rate = 12 hours Polling Duration = 24 hours Total Polling Time Frame = 3 Days Alert 2: \\(λ\\) is .01 \\(t\\) is every 24 hours \\(n\\) is percentage of time an alert was open normalized Polling Rate = 24 hours Polling Duration = 24 hours Total Polling Time Frame = 3 Days The duration in this scenario is set largest duration between polls (in this case 24 hours). If we had the following data for the alerts: Days 1 1 2 2 3 3 Alert 1 Poll x x x x 0 x Alert 2 Poll - x - x - x In the grid above, \"x\" is an occurrence, \"0\" is no occurrence, and \"–\" indicates no poll. To normalize so we would get the same number of time frames to calculate occurrence for, we would divide the number of total occurrences in each time frame by the number of potential occurrences Days Alert 1 Alert 2 Time (hrs) Alert 1 Occ. Score by Day Alert 2 Occ. Score by Day 1 2/2 1/1 48 .618 .618 2 2/2 1/1 24 .786 .786 3 1/2 1/1 0 .5 1 Total 1.90 2.40 Alert 2, which occurs at every interval, has an occurrence score of 2.4 with an aggressive decay factor. While the most recent occurrence receives the maximum score of 1.0, the high decay factor significantly reduces the weight of occurrences from three days ago. For comparison, we applied the same decay factor to Alert 1. However, Alert 1's latest value was normalized to 0.5 since the condition was true for only half of the potential instances. This normalization reduced Alert 1's occurrence score to 1.90, compared to Alert 2's score of 2.4. The difference in scores demonstrates how recent occurrences have a stronger influence than older ones. The combination of normalization and decay rates effectively handles both varying polling frequencies and the diminishing relevance of historical occurrences Scores can also be adjusted based on other factors. Below shows an example based on the type of alert and how different decay rates affect the scores if decay rates are based on recommendations. Hours Elapsed Critical (rate: 0.05) Vibration (rate: 0.1) Temperature (rate: 0.3) Pressure (rate: 0.5) Transient (rate: 0.8) 0 1.000 1.000 1.000 1.000 1.000 1 0.951 0.905 0.741 0.607 0.449 2 0.905 0.819 0.549 0.368 0.202 4 0.819 0.670 0.301 0.135 0.041 8 0.670 0.449 0.091 0.018 0.002 12 0.549 0.301 0.027 0.002 0.000 24 0.301 0.091 0.001 0.000 0.000 Decay rates can also be adjusted based on an asset's criticality. For example: Critical assets: Use lower decay rates (0.05 - 0.1) Non-critical assets: Use higher decay rates (0.3 - 0.5) Maintenance-dependent alerts: Use very low decay rates (0.01 - 0.05) 2. Priority by Asset for Multiple Recommendation Alert Types Outcome – Priority score by Asset For the various recommendation alert types for an asset, we need to calculate individual occurrence scores for each Recommendation Alert type and then aggregate them into a single asset-level occurrence score. This approach ensures that we consider all alert types while maintaining a single score for use in the RPN (Risk Priority Number) calculation. Step 1: Calculate Individual Occurrence Scores Calculated as per Section 1 or Section 2 Step 2: Aggregate Occurrence Scores After calculating individual occurrence scores, aggregate them into a single asset-level score. Here are three methods to consider: Maximum Method: Asset Occurrence = max(O₁, O₂, ..., Oₙ) Where O₁, O₂, etc. are occurrence scores for each alert type. Weighted Average: (Recommended) Asset Occurrence = (w₁ * O₁ + w₂ * O₂ + ... + wₙ * Oₙ) / (w₁ + w₂ + ... + wₙ) Where w₁, w₂, etc. are weights assigned to each alert type based on their importance. Logarithmic Sum: Asset Occurrence = exp(log(O₁) + log(O₂) + ... + log(Oₙ)) Weighted Average is recommended as the preferred method. the method that best fits your system's requirements and risk assessment strategy. Step 3: Normalize the Score Ensure the final asset occurrence score falls within your desired range (e.g., 1-10) by applying appropriate scaling or normalization. Step 4: Integrate with RPN Calculation for each asset Use this aggregated asset occurrence score in your RPN formula: RPN = Severity * Asset Occurrence * Detectability Example Calculation using Event Frames. Refer Section 1.2 for the calculation of occurrence for tags. Let's consider an asset with two alert types: Alert Type 1: x₁ = 100 alerts a = 0.5, m = 0.1, c = 3 Occurrence₁ = 1/0.5 * log₂(0.1 * 100) + 3 = 9.64 Alert Type 2: x₂ = 50 alerts a = 0.5, m = 0.2, c = 3 Occurrence₂ = 1/0.5 * log₂(0.2 * 50) + 3 = 9.32 Using the weighted average method with w₁ = 1.2 and w₂ = 1: Asset Occurrence = (1.2 * 9.64 + 1 * 9.32) / (1.2 + 1) = 9.50 Step 5: Calculate the Asset Priority Asset Priority = Asset Criticality * RPN Considerations Address assets with no alerts of a particular type by setting a minimum occurrence value (e.g., 1) or using zero, depending on your risk assessment strategy. The 'Run Recommendation' agent should update the 'x' values (number of alerts) for each alert type. The logarithmic function moderates the growth of the occurrence score for assets with frequent alerts while still capturing the significance of alert frequency. Regularly review and adjust the parameters (a, m, c, and weights) to ensure the system accurately reflects your organization's risk priorities. Appendix 2 - Analysis of Risk Priority Number (RPN) Implementation in Asset Performance Management: Limitations and Opportunities Abstract We examine the theoretical foundations and practical limitations of Risk Priority Number (RPN) implementation in Asset Performance Management (APM) systems. While RPN serves as a cornerstone metric in failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), significant challenges emerge in its practical application. Through critical analysis of current literature and industry practices, this study identifies key limitations in RPN methodology and proposes potential enhancements for more effective risk assessment in industrial settings. Introduction Risk Priority Number (RPN) has long served as a fundamental tool in risk assessment and failure mode analysis. However, as industrial systems grow in complexity and the demands for precise risk quantification increase, the traditional RPN methodology faces several challenges that warrant careful examination. This paper aims to critically analyse these limitations and explore potential solutions for modern industrial applications. 1. Theoretical Framework 1.1 Traditional RPN Calculation The traditional RPN calculation follows the formula: RPN = Severity × Occurrence × Detection Where: Severity (S) represents the seriousness of failure Occurrence (O) represents the likelihood of failure Detection (D) represents the probability of detecting failure before impact 1.2 Mathematical Limitations 1.2.1 Scale Constraints Despite the theoretical range of 1-1000, the multiplicative nature of RPN produces only 120 unique values, creating significant gaps in the risk assessment spectrum. This limitation impacts the granularity of risk differentiation and can lead to clustering of risk scores. 1.2.2 Equal Weighting Problem The multiplicative relationship between factors assumes equal importance of S, O, and D, which often contradicts operational reality where severity might warrant greater consideration in critical systems. 1.2.3 Different Polling Intervals Traditional Risk Priority Number (RPN) calculations face significant challenges when applied to modern asset monitoring systems. In XMPro, data collection happens at widely varying intervals - from every 5 minutes to every 90 days - rather than continuously. This creates a fundamental measurement problem: alerts from different sampling frequencies cannot be directly compared. For example, equipment monitored every 5 minutes has 288 daily opportunities to trigger an alert, while quarterly oil sampling provides only 4 chances per year. Additionally, we cannot accurately measure how long a condition persists between samples. These limitations require a new approach that accounts for both sampling frequency differences and condition duration. 2. Practical Implementation Challenges 2.1 Subjectivity in Scoring A significant challenge in RPN implementation lies in the subjective nature of score assignment. Different assessors may assign varying scores to identical situations based on: Personal experience and expertise Local operational context Individual risk perception Organizational culture 2.2 Contextual Limitations 2.2.1 Industry-Specific Concerns The generic nature of RPN calculation fails to account for industry-specific risk factors and regulatory requirements. Different industries may require different emphasis on various risk components. 2.2.2 Asset-Specific Considerations The standardized approach may not adequately address: Unique failure modes of specific asset types Complex interdependencies between systems Varying operational contexts 2.2.3 Risk Masking Critical risks may be obscured when: High-severity risks receive low overall RPN due to low occurrence Critical failure modes are underweighted due to high detection capability Multiple moderate risks accumulate without triggering threshold alerts 3. Proposed Enhancements 3.1 Modified RPN Calculations To address the limitations of traditional RPN, several modified approaches warrant consideration: 3.1.1 Weighted RPN We propose an enhanced calculation methodology incorporating weighted components: Modified RPN = (w₁S × w₂O × w₃D) Where w₁, w₂, and w₃ represent relative importance weights determined through systematic analysis of operational requirements and risk profiles. 3.1.2 Cost-Based RPN Financial impact consideration enhances risk assessment accuracy through: Cost-Based RPN = Modified RPN × Financial Impact Factor This approach provides more nuanced risk prioritization aligned with business objectives. 3.2 Advanced Risk Assessment Framework A more comprehensive framework should include: Multiple risk assessment methodologies Industry-specific risk factors Dynamic threshold adjustment capabilities Integration with asset criticality metrics 4. Implementation Recommendations 4.1 Systematic Approach Organizations implementing RPN should: Establish clear scoring guidelines Provide comprehensive assessor training Implement regular calibration exercises Document scoring rationale Regularly review and update risk assessment criteria 4.2 Technology Integration Modern APM systems should incorporate: Machine learning for pattern recognition Real-time data analytics Automated threshold adjustment Historical trend analysis Integration with broader asset management systems 5. Future Research Directions Several areas warrant further investigation: Development of industry-specific RPN modifications Integration of artificial intelligence in risk assessment Validation of modified RPN methodologies Quantification of subjective assessment impacts Cost-benefit analysis of enhanced risk assessment methods 6. Conclusion While RPN remains a valuable tool in risk assessment, its limitations necessitate careful consideration and potential modification for modern industrial applications. The proposed enhancements and implementation recommendations provide a framework for improving risk assessment accuracy while maintaining practical applicability in industrial settings."

    "summary": "Sizing Guideline This is a guideline for the compute resources needed for the different components in a deployment. Small, medium, and large sizing estimates are provided. The small option starts with the minimum recommended resources and, generally, each subsequent size doubles the number of CPU cores and available RAM. Not all components experience the same increase in load, so the estimates may not increase at the same rate for all components. Many factors influence the number of Apps and Data Streams a deployment can effectively run. These factors include: the number of data streams, how frequently the streams process data, the size of the data payload, the number of recommendations to be monitored, the number of apps and event boards being served, the complexity of apps and event boards (the number of elements and integration points), and the number of concurrent users accessing the apps and event boards. As a rough guide, an example workload for a Medium-sized deployment would be: ~200 Data Streams running across ~15 Stream Hosts, serving data and triggering recommendations for ~10 Apps On-Premise Component Small Medium Large Subscription Manager (SM) 1 2 CPU 8GB RAM 2 CPU 8GB RAM 4 CPU 16GB RAM Application Designer (AD) 2 CPU 8GB RAM 4 CPU 16GB RAM 8 CPU 32GB RAM Data Stream Designer (DS) 2 CPU 8GB RAM 4 CPU 16GB RAM 8 CPU 32GB RAM Stream Host Server (SH) 2,3 2 CPU 8GB RAM 4 CPU 16GB RAM 8 CPU 32GB RAM SQL Database Server (Combined for SM, AD, DS) 4 2 CPU 8GB RAM 4 CPU 16GB RAM 8 CPU 32GB RAM Note Footnotes 1 High volumes of concurrent users may require additional compute. 2 Multiple Stream Hosts can be deployed to the Stream Host Server. 3 If the Stream Host needs more resources, consider increasing the RAM before adding additional CPU cores as Stream Hosts perform in-memory processing of events. 4 High volumes of recommendations may require additional compute and storage.

App Designer Time Series Chart Block This new block in the App Designer toolbox allows you to visualize large amounts of time series data to give your engineers and operators a real-time view of your asset health. You can use a variety of data sources to populate your Time Series Chart, but a key benefit is that the asset hierarchy can be integrated with Azure Digital Twins and the telemetry data can be loaded from Azure Data Explorer. Useful features built into the Time Series Chart block include the ability to drop markers on the chart to denote important events, as well as panning and zooming to change the timescale. You can show or hide assets and parameters via the hierarchy panel. This visualization makes it easy to compare different assets with each other across multiple parameters, like temperature, pressure and vibration. Grid Block We've expanded the functionality of the Grid Block in the App Designer toolbox to include visual indicators, which allow you to show the state of an item in the grid. This is particularly useful if you want to use colours to indicate the health of an asset or the status of a root cause analysis. There are also new column options for select boxes and hyperlinks, making it easier to choose from a predefined list or navigate to a subpage from the grid. You can set default filters to automatically organize your grid data when you load the page. And we've added support for column reordering, resizing and state persistence. Notification Templates XMPro Recommendations allow you to send automated email and SMS notifications to inform your team about a critical event occurring in your data. You can now create custom templates for those notifications simply by uploading an HTML file for email or adding your text message for SMS. Placeholders in your templates enable you to replace static text in your notifications with real-time data about the recommendation alert like its title, how long it has been pending, and the real-time data that triggered the alert. Data Stream Designer Stream Metrics We've added Stream Metrics to Data Streams to give you more visibility into the health of your Data Streams. Once a Data Stream is published, you will be able to see how much data is being processed per minute as well as how many errors were generated by Agents in the Stream. You'll also have better visibility into how many of your Stream Hosts are online. Error Flow How do you know when your Data Stream health is deteriorating? With the new Error Flow feature you can create a separate set of actions that trigger when your Data Stream encounters errors. For example, the Data Stream can send out an email to notify you if the issues if there are more than a certain number of errors occurring per minute. Connector Documentation We've made major updates to our documentation for the growing XMPro connector library. Our team has added more example videos and GIFs to help you confidently configure agents on your own. Platform Security As part of our continuous commitment to security, we've implemented quarterly scans of our platform. Veracode scans the software and tests it in multiple ways, including using Static Analysis (white-box testing), Dynamic Analysis (black-box testing), and Software Composition Analysis.

Application Designer Recommendation and Alert Scoring When setting up a Recommendation, authors are now able to fine-tune the Alert Recommendation priority by changing its score. By contrast, Alert Ranking only has options for High, Medium, and Low. Alert Scores are calculated based on these factors: Recommendation - The importance of the recommendation itself Recommendation Category - The importance of the recommendation's category Recommendation Rule - The importance of the specific rule Recommendation Optional- Additional Rule Factor value retrieved from the Data Stream. As a recommendation creator, assigning a score to an alert lets you control its importance level more precisely. This Score helps the alert recipient to understand its relative importance. Viewing the Alerts You can view the order of alerts in the Recommendation Alerts list. You can also view the Scores using the Score Factor Matrix. Follow the steps mentioned here. Auto-Assigning of an Escalated Recommendation Alert This enhancement automatically assigns an escalated recommendation alert to the previous owner of the original alert. To use this, simply check \"enable execution order\" and \"auto-escalate\" with the specified rules. You can view this as a timeline entry that creates an audit trail. Query Optimization for AD Experience faster performance and quicker AD queries through optimized Entity Framework settings for database queries. Subscription Manager New Permission - Hide Users Outside of Business Roles This new permission prevents users' information from being exposed to users who are not in the same business role group or any of the parent business role groups, enhancing privacy and security. Data Stream Designer Agent Category Visual Indicator Introduced color palettes as visual cues for agent categories.

    "title": "What's New in 4.3 | XMPro",
    "summary": "What's New in 4.3 Overview Introducing the XMPro 4.3 release, where we continue to prioritize initiatives aligned with our higher goals of achieving faster time to value, distributed intelligence, and secure deployments. Our product roadmap outlines how each initiative serves a specific purpose within these categories. We have concentrated our efforts on two key initiatives: the cloud-to-edge continuum and AI & engineering excellence. These areas reflect our commitment to delivering cutting-edge solutions and ensuring excellence in artificial intelligence and engineering practices. Cloud-to-Edge Continuum The XMPro platform needs to be performant, scalable, and monitored in order to be fully cloud agnostic. We strive to implement industry best practices to achieve this. Auto Scale - Distributed Caching This feature aligns with the EDGE continuum bucket, enabling XMPro to run distributed infrastructure essential for HDT cloud computing. Auto Scale, XMPro's implementation of caching has been overhauled with a distributed storage feature that promises improved caching capabilities. It offers a superior caching approach that is highly recommended, particularly for larger production-ready implementations. It uses a technology called Redis, a flexible technology that offers a distributed storage feature that makes use of multiple smaller cache entries. In this setup, some nodes act as masters, handling the processing of data, while others serve as backups. This way, if one node goes down, the others can take over to keep the system running smoothly. These changes improve the performance and reliability of our caching system, ensuring that data is stored and accessed efficiently, particularly for larger production-ready implementations. Health Check Endpoints The introduction of health check endpoints is essential for cloud-agnostic applications as they enable platform independence and decouple it from specific cloud provider dependencies, like Azure's Application Insights. Health check endpoints play a crucial role by allowing easy identification of problems without requiring extensive technical knowledge or login credentials. They provide a snapshot of each XMPro product's health, including its interconnected components and overall system status. Administrators can configure health checks and add additional systems to monitor, further enhancing the product's stability and performance. The output can be consumed by your preferred provider, such as Azure's Application Insights, or use the default Health UI. Logging Provider Support Logging Provider Support is a new feature that introduces the implementation of Serilog, a diagnostic logging library for .NET applications. This library enables the capture of log events with structured data. Providing administrators with valuable insights into the behavior and performance of XMPro. Three logging outputs are supported: Logging to file support has been added for all XMPro products, whereas Application Insights and Datadog support has been added for all products aside from Subscription Manager. These are cloud-based application monitoring and analytics services. Deployment Automation We've changed the way our database installs and upgrades are applied. For new installs, our products will automatically install the required database changes. For upgrades, our products will detect what database changes are needed and make these. We are moving away from doing database installs and upgrades from the desktop installer, with all database installs and upgrades happening automatically from within the products. Accelerate time to value by choosing to automatically deploy the regular, smaller releases to your pre-prod environment, rather than less frequent, larger upgrades. AI and Engineering Excellence The new XMPro AI article describes various ways in which AI is infused into the Digital Twin Platform. XMPro Notebook This release introduces the XMPro Notebook, which is an embedded version of Jupyterhub and will be available for evaluation on new XMPro Freemium accounts. XMPro Notebook provides an intuitive and flexible interface for data analysis, scientific computing, machine learning, and more. Users can write code and execute cells independently, which facilitates step-by-step exploration and experimentation with real-time data. Existing customers and Freemium users can contact us for access and licensing options. Please visit XMPro AI for more information about XMPro AI and XMPro's Intelligent Digital Twin Suite. Application Designer's Time Series Chart Performance Performance of the Time Series Chart Block, when using the new TSC SQL Connector, has been significantly enhanced due to optimized client-side querying. The advantage of this Connector is that it is optimized for server-side processing of the required grouping into buckets needed for the Time Series Chart data points, reducing the response time and size, and enabling quicker retrieval of data for longer periods. Look out for the future release of TSC-optimized Azure Data Explorer and Historian Connectors."

    "summary": "What's New in 4.4 Overview In this release we have concentrated our efforts on two key initiatives: the cloud-to-edge continuum and AI & engineering excellence. These areas reflect our commitment to delivering cutting-edge solutions and ensuring excellence in artificial intelligence and engineering practices. This page shows a curated selection of features. For more details on what's in the latest version, please read the Release Notes. Note Image Migration Note: Fig 1: The areas in focus this release - This image needs to be created and placed in the images directory. Cloud-to-Edge Continuum Theme The XMPro platform needs to be performant, scalable, and monitored to be fully cloud-agnostic. We strive to implement industry best practices to achieve this. Stream Host Improvements Stream Hosts are vital to Data Stream performance. We've rewritten the Stream Hosts to guarantee higher levels of performance. As part of the site's upgrade to v4.4.0, you will also need to install the new Stream Hosts. Stream Hosts are optimized for reliable orchestration of data streams and interactions such as publish, unpublish, sync with Data Stream Designer, and handling network disconnections. This ensures more reliable and performance-driven data flow management across cloud and edge environments. Enhanced logging capabilities, including detailed agent lifecycle events, provide deeper insights into the operation of Stream Hosts, facilitating better monitoring and troubleshooting. AI and Engineering Excellence Theme AI and Engineering is a core pillar, aiming to harness algorithms, data insights, and computational methodologies that enhance our product's capability to build innovative solutions that address complex challenges. Metablocks The new feature, Metablocks, is the first step towards plug-and-play Blocks. The first two Metablocks, Unity and Unity (Legacy), demonstrate how the modular approach improves performance. It opens the ability to support different web technologies. Metablocks represent a significant advancement in XMPro's Application Development Platform, offering a flexible, secure, and performance-oriented solution for web application development. These blocks are designed to empower engineers and developers by enhancing app performance, security posture, and overall development experience within the App Designer (AD) environment. See Metablocks for a full description. Tree Map Block Note Image Migration Note: Fig 2: Tree Map Block - This image needs to be created and placed in the images directory. This new App Designer block (v4.4.0) allows you to visualize hierarchical data as a set of nested rectangles whose sizes are proportional to the visualized values. You can create tactical visualizations that showcase both hierarchical and magnitude data about operations, rather than 2D lists. For example, the relative number of recommendation alerts across different asset class and location segments. Live Feed Block Note Image Migration Note: Fig 3: Live Feed Block - This image needs to be created and placed in the images directory. This new block (v4.4.0) allows you to incorporate your IP Live Feed cameras into an application. Recommendation Analytics Block and Recommendation Alert Discussion Block These two new blocks (v4.3.2) pave the way for composable Recommendation Alert pages. In future releases, we will build on the composable recommendation functionality, enabling you to design your recommendation application – should you choose not to use the out-of-the-box option. Recommendation Analytics gives a quick view of the percentage change and alerts generated for an asset – ideal for analyzing recommendations and supporting decision-making processes. Recommendation Alert Discussion facilitates collaboration by allowing teams to discuss and act upon recommendations within the platform. Global Notification Communicate important information to all users across the XMPro suite with the new Global Notification feature. Global Administrators can display a global notification for a specific period, such as planned maintenance downtime along with a hyperlink to release notes. Choose from a type of hint, warning, or error to style the notification icon and banner color. Note Image Migration Note: Fig 4: A global notification appears on the landing page - This image needs to be created and placed in the images directory. Admin Reports Do you want to upgrade your Agent and Connector integrations but are unsure which versions are currently loaded or where they've been used? We've added reports (v4.3.7) to support designers in creating an upgrade path. A master report to find the most recent version installed, and a detail report to identify Applications and Data Streams that are using older versions. Note Image Migration Note: Fig 5: Data Stream Designer's Agent Usage Report - This image needs to be created and placed in the images directory. Support Issues Addressed We addressed two major support issues. Subscription Manager Memory Issue We've resolved a critical memory management issue, ensuring smoother operation and enhancing the platform stability (v4.4.0). Live View Issue We've resolved a connection management issue by automatically turning off Live View (v4.3.7). This reduces the additional load on the Data Stream Designer. Conclusion This update is primarily about the improvement and scaling of Stream Hosts as part of our commitment to performance within our Cloud to Edge Continuum theme. We also have many new features as part of the AI & Engineering Intelligence Themes. Previous Versions What's New in 4.3 What's New in 4.2 What's New in 4.1.13 What's New in 4.1 What's New in 4.0"
