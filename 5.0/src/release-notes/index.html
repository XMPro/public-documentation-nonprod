      <td>Fix</td>
      <td><b>Survey Archiving Display</b>: When you archive a survey in a recommendation, the survey would continue to appear active until you manually refreshed the page. This was confusing as it suggested the archiving action hadn't worked. The survey block now updates its display state immediately when archived, providing instant visual feedback that the action was successful.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Fix</td>
      <td><b>Timeline URL Navigation</b>: When you click on timeline entries to navigate to specific time periods or events, the URL navigation wasn't working properly, leaving you on the same view regardless of your selection. Timeline navigation now works correctly, allowing you to bookmark specific time periods and navigate directly to timeline events via URL parameters.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Fix</td>
      <td><b>Email Notification Links</b>: When you receive email notifications about alerts, clicking the links in the email would take you to the standard alert view instead of the specific alert context. Email notification links now direct you to the appropriate alert view with proper context, making it easier to act on notifications directly from your inbox.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Fix</td>
      <td><b>Tree Grid Selection Persistence</b>: When you configure a Tree Grid with multiple selection enabled and set default selections, the defaults wouldn't persist after page load. You would have to manually reselect items each time you visited the page. Tree Grid controls now properly retain their multiple selection defaults on page load, maintaining your configured selections.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Fix</td>
      <td><b>Data Grid DateTime Filters</b>: When you set up a Data Grid with DateTime columns, the row filter options didn't match those available for Date columns, limiting your filtering capabilities. DateTime columns now have the same comparison operators as Date columns, giving you consistent filtering options across different date-related data types.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Fix</td>
      <td><b>Data Source Field Sorting</b>: When you configure data sources in App Designer, the field list wasn't sorted alphabetically, making it difficult to find specific fields in large datasets. Data source fields are now sorted alphabetically, improving the designer experience when working with complex data structures.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Fix</td>
      <td><b>Template Category Persistence</b>: When you assign a template category to an application, the category would sometimes disappear or not save properly. Template categories now persist correctly, ensuring your application organization and categorization remains intact.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Fix</td>
      <td><b>Validation Groups</b>: When you use validation groups in App Designer, various issues could occur that prevented proper validation behavior. Validation group functionality has been improved to work reliably across different component configurations.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Fix</td>
      <td><b>Notes Auto-Update Prevention</b>: When you work with notes in recommendations, notes would automatically update without prompting you, even when notes were null or previously saved. This could lead to unintended overwrites of your content. Notes now only update when you explicitly save them, preventing accidental data loss and ensuring your notes remain under your control.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Fix</td>
      <td><b>Application Name Translations</b>: Application names were inconsistently translated across different products, with some showing incorrect or misleading translations (particularly affecting Portuguese-Brazil). Application names now display consistently and accurately across all products and locales.</td>
