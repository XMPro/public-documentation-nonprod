<div class="WARNING">
<h5>Warning</h5>
<p>We strongly recommend that all Stream Host installations are upgraded to this version and that the feature flag 'Enable Luigi Preview', is enabled to leverage the enhanced capabilities fully.</p>
<p><br>
If you upgrade to the XMPro Product Suite v4.4.0 but <strong>continue using an older Stream Host</strong> (v4.3.12 or earlier), <strong>you will have a degraded experience</strong> because the Stream Host logs will not be visible in Data Stream Designer. This applies to both Stream-specific logs and Collection Logs in general.</p>
