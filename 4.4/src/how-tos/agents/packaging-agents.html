<h1 id="packaging-agents">Packaging Agents</h1>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>The XMPro Package Manager is a Windows 11 desktop application that enables you to package a new Agent or update details for an existing Agent. <a href="../../concepts/agent/index.html">See the Agent article for more information on Agents</a>.</p>
<p>This application takes you through the process of specifying all the properties your Agent requires, adding or changing the controls for each of the user settings, and uploading the DLL files of the <a href="building-agents.html">Agent code</a>. It will provide you, upon completion, with a file that can be uploaded to Data Stream Designer after which you can build Data Streams using the Agent.</p>
<p>You can download the software from the Microsoft Windows 10 Store or by clicking <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/xmpro-package-manager/9n3f4wnslgzk?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/xmpro-package-manager-win-store.png" alt="XMPro Package Manager"></p>
<p>After installing the XMPro Package Manager, launch the application from the Microsoft Store or search for &quot;XMPro Package Manager&quot; in the Start menu and then click on &quot;XMPro Package Manager&quot;.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>You can run multiple instances of Package Manager at the same time. This side-by-side comparison is helpful when developing a new Agent that is similar to another; or comparing different versions of the same Agent.</p>
</div>
<p><img src="../../images/package-manager-interface.png" alt="XMPro Package Manager interface"></p>
<h2 id="new--import">New / Import</h2>
<p>On the first screen of the application, you can either create a new Agent package or import and update an existing one.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Use the arrows at the bottom of the page section to move forward or backward in the application.</p>
<p>When you import an existing package, you have the option to export the package as a JSON file. This is useful either to compare packages or for source control and version management.</p>
<p>You can also import the JSON file from an existing package, which is particularly useful if you need to modify translations added through the <a href="#include-multilingual-support">Include Multilingual Support</a> feature.</p>
</div>
<p><img src="../../images/new-import-package.png" alt="New or import package"></p>
<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>The Details form allows you to configure the properties of an Agent. These properties are listed and explained below.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/package-manager-details.png" alt="Package Manager Details"></p>
<h3 id="name">Name</h3>
<p>The name of the Agent is what the Agent will be known as once it is uploaded to the Data Stream Designer platform, for example, &quot;<em>Jupyter Notebook</em>&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="category">Category</h3>
<p>The <a href="../../concepts/agent/index.html#categories">category</a> is selected based on the function the Agent performs, for example, &quot;<em>AI &amp; Machine Learning</em>&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>The description is a brief explanation of what the Agent does, for example, &quot;<em>This Action Agent allows you to create and load Jupyter Notebook files</em>&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="version">Version</h3>
<p>The <a href="../../concepts/version.html">version</a> of the Agent. Any real number is acceptable, for example, &quot;<em>1.02</em>&quot;.</p>
<div class="CAUTION">
<h5>Caution</h5>
<p>If you make a change to an existing Agent, make sure you increment the version number as Data Stream Designer will not allow you to upload two of the same Agents with the same version.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="virtual">Virtual</h3>
<p>Agents can be classified as either <a href="../../concepts/agent/virtual-vs-non-virtual-agents.html">Virtual or Non-Virtual.</a></p>
<p>An Agent is Virtual if it is not specific to a certain environment and can be configured remotely. Non-Virtual Agents have to be in their respective environments to be able to function correctly, e.g. the SQL Server Agent, which has to connect to SQL Server via the intranet.</p>
<h3 id="entry-point">Entry Point</h3>
<p>The entry point is the namespace and class name of the actual Agent's DLL file.</p>
<p>For example, if an Agent with the class name &quot;<em>ActionAgent&quot;</em> is located in the <em>XMPro.JupyterNotebookAgents</em> namespace, the Entry Endpoint for it would be &quot;<em>XMPro.JupyterNotebookAgents.ActionAgent&quot;.</em></p>
<h3 id="isolated-loading">Isolated Loading</h3>
<p>When loading Agents to use in a Stream Host, all the libraries are put in a separate <em>Load Context.</em> Tick <em>Isolated Loading</em> to keep Agent files separate and reduce the risk of libraries clashing or conflicting together. In most cases, this option should be enabled.</p>
<h3 id="icon-file">Icon File</h3>
<p>The icon used to represent your Agent. Click the <em>Browse</em> button, navigate to where you've stored the file via the Explorer and select the new image file.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>It is recommended that you upload either a JPG or PNG file with a size of 64Ã—64 pixels to accommodate for retina displays.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="require-input-map">Require Input Map</h3>
<p>Tick <em>Require Input Map</em> to specify that your Agent will be receiving events in a defined structure. The arrow leading to your Agent will be configurable to allow the user to map the inputs of your Agent to incoming attributes.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>If left unticked, parent outputs will be published to this Agent as they are.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="add-on-error-endpoint">Add On-Error Endpoint?</h3>
<p>Tick to add an additional Output Endpoint, called an Error Endpoint.</p>
<p>An Error Endpoint will output error information when your stream is running and something goes wrong, making debugging easier. You can also define actions that will be executed after error data is sent to the next Agent in the stream by your Agent, for example when a certain record is not valid.</p>
<h2 id="endpoints">Endpoints</h2>
<p>The Endpoints form allows you to specify any Input or Output Endpoints.</p>
<h3 id="input-endpoints">Input Endpoints</h3>
<p>These Endpoints represent entry points to the Agent, which will allow the Agent to receive data or input from another Agent.</p>
<p>To add an Input Endpoint, type it's name in the text field and click <em>Add</em>. The new Endpoint will appear in the list below the Add button. You may need to hover over the list and scroll down to see it. As per the image, an Input Endpoint named &quot;Input&quot; has been added.</p>
<div class="CAUTION">
<h5>Caution</h5>
<p>The name of the Input Endpoints has to match what has been defined in the Agent's code.</p>
</div>
<p>To remove an existing Endpoint, scroll down in the list until you see it, select the Endpoint and click on the <em>Remove</em> button.</p>
<h3 id="output-endpoints">Output Endpoints</h3>
<p>Output Endpoints represent exit points from an Agent and allow you to connect your Agent to another Agent, making it possible to pass data from your Agent to another Agent.</p>
<p>To add an Output Endpoint, type it's name in the text field, change the Endpoint Type to &quot;Output&quot;, and click <em>Add</em>. The new Endpoint will appear in the list below the Add button. You may need to hover over the list underneath the text field and scroll down before being able to see it. In the image, an Output Endpoint named &quot;<em>Output</em>&quot; has been added.</p>
<div class="CAUTION">
<h5>Caution</h5>
<p>The name of the Output Endpoints should match what has been defined in the Agent's code.</p>
</div>
<p>To remove an existing Endpoint, scroll down in the list until you see it, select the Endpoint and click on the <em>Delete</em> button.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/endpoints-config.png" alt="Endpoints configuration"></p>
<h2 id="references">References</h2>
<p>The References form is where you upload the file(s) required for the Agent to execute. Only files in the <em>Selected File(s)</em> list will be included in the package, and any DLLs must be created in .NET.</p>
<p>To upload a file, click the <em>Browse</em> button next to the <em>DLL File(s)</em> field and navigate to where the files are located. Select all the files needed and click the <em>Add</em> button to add them to the <em>Selected File(s)</em> list.</p>
<p>To remove a file from the list, click the <em>Delete</em> button next to the file name in the <em>Selected File(s)</em> list.</p>

<p><img src="../../images/references-config.png" alt="References configuration"></p>
<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>Depending on what your Agent does, it might require that the user provide certain information, such as a server URL, username, or password. For each of these information fields (or <em>settings</em>), you need to specify which control should be used and what each control represents, for example, the Jupyter Notebook Agent will require the user to add a server URL. The user should provide this value using a text-box control. Thus, you need to create a control with a type of &quot;TextBox&quot; and a caption that reads &quot;Server URL&quot; in the XMPro Package Manager application.</p>
<p>The following controls are available to be used to capture user input:</p>
<ul>
<li>Button</li>
<li>CheckBox</li>
<li>CheckList</li>
<li>DropDown</li>
<li>EditList</li>
<li>FileUpload</li>
<li>Filter</li>
<li>Grid</li>
<li>Group</li>
<li>HTML Editor</li>
<li>NumberBox</li>
<li>ScriptBox</li>
<li>TextBox</li>
<li>Title</li>
<li>TokenBox</li>
<li>VariableBox</li>
</ul>
<p>Each control has several properties that have to be set and not all properties apply to all controls. For example, options apply to a drop-down control and not a text-box control.</p>
<p>The table below contains a list of all the available properties, their description, and to which controls they are applicable.</p>

<h3 id="adding-settings">Adding Settings</h3>
<p>Settings are grouped logically into one or more groups, such as authentication, criteria, and output.</p>
<p>Create a group first, then add controls for settings to the group. To do this, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the plus-icon (top right, next to the Settings header). A form section will open, allowing you to specify a group for the settings.</li>
<li>Specify a unique value that can be used as the key for the group.</li>
<li>Add the caption you would like to use.</li>
<li>Click <em>Save.</em></li>
<li>Next, we are going to add a setting. Click on the plus-icon next to the group you've created.</li>
<li>Choose the type of control you would like to use.</li>
<li>Add a unique key for your control. This key must correspond to what you defined in your code.</li>
<li>Add a caption for your control.</li>
<li>If needed, add a default value.</li>
<li>If required, add help text.</li>
<li>Select the options that apply from the list of check-boxes.</li>
<li>Click <em>Save</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="../../images/add-group.png" alt="Adding a group"></p>
<p><img src="../../images/add-setting.png" alt="Adding a setting"></p>
<h2 id="output">Output</h2>
<h3 id="export-as-json-file">Export as JSON file</h3>
<p>Tick the checkbox <strong>Export as JSON file too?</strong> if you would like to export the file as JSON too. It will later be saved to the same directory as the XMP file with the file name <em>category_name_version</em>.json.</p>
<h3 id="include-multilingual-support">Include Multilingual Support</h3>
<p>Tick the checkbox <strong>Include Multilingual Support?</strong> if you would like to add support for languages other than English. Uncheck languages you don't want to include.</p>
<p>This feature leverages generative AI to provide language translation. It is available only if the following requirements are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are connected to the internet.</li>
<li>Open AI is configured (Click <a href="#configure-openai">here</a> for instructions on how to do so).</li>
</ul>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<ul>
<li>Only the Agent Description, Properties and Static Helptext are translated. Internal messages and dynamic Helptext added when <a href="building-agents.html">building the Agent</a> are not included.</li>
<li>Multilingual support requires XMPro Data Stream Designer and Stream Host v4.4.16+.</li>
<li>Override the automated translations by editing the JSON file and repackaging it with an incremented version number.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><img src="../../images/pm-output-1.png" alt="Output configuration"></p>
<h3 id="configure-openai">Configure OpenAI</h3>
<ol>
<li>Click <em>Configure OpenAI</em>.</li>

<p>Lastly, you can navigate back through the steps to review the details that you've specified. If you are satisfied, complete the wizard by clicking the Save button below before navigating to the folder where you would like the package to be exported. Your package will be created with the file name <em>category_name_version</em>.xmp.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>If you imported an existing file, take care to:</p>
<ul>
<li>either click 'Save as new Agent' to generate a new Agent, or click 'Save' to generate a new version of the original Agent.</li>
<li>ensure you select a different location folder or increment the version to avoid overwriting the original.</li>
