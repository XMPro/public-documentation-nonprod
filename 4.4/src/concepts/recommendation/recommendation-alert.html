<h1 id="recommendation-alert">Recommendation Alert</h1>

<p>Recommendation Alerts are advanced alerts that are triggered when real-time data meets the criteria defined in a <a href="rule.html">Recommendation Rule</a>. They notify you when certain conditions occur in your data and provide decision support for how to take action.</p>
<p>The Recommendation Alerts are found by clicking on the Recommendations button in the menu on the left of the App Designer.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/image-682.png" alt="Fig 1: Access the recommendations menu"></p>
<p>The grid provides an overview of all the Alerts that you have access to. The rightmost Status column shows whether the Alert is Pending or Resolved.</p>
<p>You can order, filter by specific values, search the alerts by any of the columns, and search in all columns in the Search bar.</p>
<p>To see Resolved as well as Pending Alerts, check the &quot;Show Archived&quot; checkbox.</p>
<p>Click on an Alert in the grid to navigate to the Recommendation Alert details.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/image-912.png" alt="Fig 2: The recommendation alerts grid"></p>
<h2 id="finding-recommendation-alerts">Finding Recommendation Alerts</h2>
